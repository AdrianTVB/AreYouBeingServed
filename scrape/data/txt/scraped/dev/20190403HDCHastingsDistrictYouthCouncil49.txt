Youth Council (YC) members were invited to work with council officers as part
of a working group to develop Albert Square – they would build on
the work that had been started with the 2018 Youth Council.  The aim was
to finish the work this year.

Proposed New Youth Council Logo
The Marketing and Communications
Advisor, Gina Armstrong, circulated a sheet
titled “What is a design brief?” (CG-14-33-00086) and spoke to the main points, explaining about
rebranding and preparing a design brief.  Once the brief had been
compiled and forwarded to Gina, she would prepare some concepts that would be
presented to the YC for consideration as its new logo.
The Youth Development Coordinator, Ang
Hughes, would email to the YC members the link to
the sheet that had been circulated.  She asked them to complete the
details and return them to her by Tuesday, 9 April.
Youth Week Friday, 17 May to
Sunday, 26 May 2019
This was being held in seven weeks’
time.  The YC members had asked for t-shirts, hoodies, tear drop flags,

event.  Later in the meeting the programme for the event (CG-14-33-00087)
would be addressed in more detail.
Monthly Reports
The YC members read their respective
reports into the record (CG-14-33-00077; CG-14-33-00078, CG-14-33-00089
and CG-14-33-00090).  These reports had been sent to Ang Hughes
prior to the meeting.  She asked all members to send these reports in,
even if they had nothing to report for that month.
Gumboot Day on Friday, 5 April
2019
This will be held on Friday, 5 April with
a gold coin donation going towards mental health
counselling for children.  This initiative comes from New Zealander of
the Year, Mike King, and the mental health charity I AM HOPE.  Sophie
Jones (Media Engagement) would promote this event on the
YC’s Facebook page.
There will be a community event at 12pm
in the CBD (near the clock tower) and a YC representative had been asked to
speak there.  Kate Allen (Chair) would be away so Sophie Jones would
attend in her place with Boston Wynyard.  Ang Hughes would pick them both
up to take them to the event and email the running / information sheet for
the event to them, and Sophie would promote it via the YC’s Facebook page.
Community Development Committee
meeting on Tuesday, 9 April 2019
A presentation would be made to the Community
Development meeting at 2.30pm to explain the YC’s focus for this year
and the events they were holding or attending.  The members were asked
to attend to support the presentation if possible, followed by afternoon tea
with the councillors.
Kate Allen and Charliot Miller would work
on the presentation assisted by James McPhail (Media
Engagement) and Ang Hughes if needed.  YC
members attending on 9 April: Kate Allen, Kathleen Steffert, Sophie Jones,
Boston Wynyard, Janicka Tei and Eva Harper.  On the day, Ang would pick
up Kate and Eva Harper to help get them to the meeting.

attending: Pelerose Vaima’a, Kathleen Steffert and Kate Allen.

Brain Dump Pop-Up Youth
Engagement Event - responses
Ang Hughes circulated a list that had
been compiled of the topics raised (in the form of raw data) and the number
of responses received (CG-14-33-00088).  The meeting discussed
the best way to present this information in a more visual way (graph format
– CG-14-33-00092) and it would be put onto the YC Facebook page
(e.g. featuring a different topic each week) once it had been presented to
schools.  It would be important to thank the public who had
participated.
It was suggested a Brain Dump be held at
schools with prizes for Youth Week and a social media campaign.  Ideas
for prizes were discussed - including vouchers or tickets to local events,
Laser Force or 10 pin bowling.
Verses Competition on Sunday, 14
July 2019
Zeal had invited the YC to co-host a competition
at Lindisfarne.

Youth Week Programme Friday, 17

could be involved in, the other events already listed on the calendar for
this week.

Youth Parliament
An information sheet was circulated (CG-14-33-00084)
and addressed with the covering email (CG-14-33-00083) being read out
explaining how this public submission process worked.  Submissions
closed at midnight on Sunday, 28 April 2019 with the range of topics to be
addressed set out on the circulated sheet.
Ang Hughes would send the link to the
YC’s Media Engagement team and James would promote this.
Instagram and Snapchat
Ang Hughes would send a link to Sophie
Jones regarding the council’s Social Media Engagement protocols to help
YC members who would be replying to posts on behalf of the council.  It
was important that videos or photographs posted were not covered by any copyrights
and all parties needed to have the chance to be heard to avoid any perceived
bias.
By Monday, 8 April, Ang Hughes would find
out about the protocols around boosting posts and would let Sophie Jones and
James McPhail know.
The meeting then addressed the
recommendations in the agenda report, with each recommendation being voted on
separately.  Recommendation “G” would be addressed at the
next meeting once feedback on potential logo designs had been received and
passed onto Gina Armstrong.
It was noted that once the Draft Terms of
Reference (Recommendation “C”) were adopted and endorsed by the
meeting then they would be included in each of the agendas from now on.
The Annual Plan had been addressed at the
Youth Council’s March Training and Planning Retreat (CG-14-33-00091).
This document would be continually updated as aspects are addressed and
the latest version would be included on the agenda for each of the YC
meetings this year.
