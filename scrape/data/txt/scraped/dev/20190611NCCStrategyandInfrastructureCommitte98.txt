Policy Planning
1.1   Purpose
of Report
The purpose of this report is to
follow up on recent seminars held with Council on 3 April and 2 May 2019
regarding the review of the District Plan and for Council to approve ‘in
principle’ the preferred policy direction for specific workstreams so
that officers can draft chapters of the District Plan within an agreed
framework/strategic direction.
At the Meeting
Councillors discussed the item and the following
points were raised:
·
A Councillor suggested that planning should be done to tighten
restrictions around the height of movable objects i.e. boats/campervans, to
ensure that these are in line with boundary heights. This matter has been
raised by the public with a number of Councillors as well as through
submissions made to previous years’ Long Term Plans.
·
Council is working towards facilitating city living and this is
reflected in the review of design controls for apartments in commercial
zones.
In response to questions from Councillors the
following points were clarified:
·
As the District Plan focuses on land use it may not be the most
efficient vehicle to address water conservation in new subdivisions; however,
this could be considered when Council looks at urban growth and how this
impacts the city.
·
The Chief Executive confirmed that Council will be working with
members of the Māori Consultative Committee and the Taiwhenua as part of
the District Plan review engagement process. It was also noted that Council
is currently developing a memorandum of understanding with the Taiwhenua in
relation to how we will work together on a range of issues.
·
Council has a statutory requirement to engage with everyone
that lives in Napier about the District Plan. There are plenty of
opportunities for engagement through the District Plan Review process.
·
In terms of consistency around development fees, Council
officers are currently undertaking a detailed review of the policy. It was
confirmed that decisions to waive any development fees are currently made by
way of Council decision.
·
Electric vehicles fit within the Transport Strategy, currently
being developed, which feeds into the District Plan. Electric vehicles may
also be considered as part of the utilities provision within the District
Plan. It was noted that the District Plan itself may not be the best vehicle
to make provision for electric vehicles as this mainly looks at land use.
·
Council is looking to move away from the concept of having one
standalone dwelling on a site, preferring terraced/multiple housing. In order
to meet the housing needs of the future, Council will need to be more
proactive and rely on other tools, not just the District Plan.
Committee's recommendation
Councillors
Jeffery / Wise
That the Strategy and Infrastructure
Committee:
a.     Endorse
‘in principle’ the agreed framework that the specific workstreams
will follow in the review of the District Plan.

City Strategy
2.1   Purpose
of Report
To adopt the draft Napier Parking
Strategy and the Acquisition Guidance Report.
At the Meeting
A number of Councillors spoke in support of the
Parking Strategy. It was noted that communication needs to be clearer with
the public around the reasons for removing the P120 parking in the CBD, i.e.
that Council is attempting to deter workers from using parks that should be
available for use by daily shoppers.
In response to questions from Councillors the
following points were clarified:
·
It was agreed that the feasibility of another parking deck on
the Dickens Street West parking building should be assessed as to whether
this is a practical parking option in the future. Council officers noted that
the need must first be established before the capital spend and
infrastructure investment for a project like this can be assessed.
·
Council officers confirmed that the hybrid parking arrangement
for the Tiffen parking building has been successful, with 100% uptake of the
leased parks and the bottom level at capacity most days.
·
Disability Strategy takes a broader view of the City rather
than just parking. Council’s roading engineers have certain
requirements that they must meet around disability parking.
·
It was noted that monitoring is crucial to help Council
understand the success or otherwise of changes made in this space.
Satisfaction surveys will also be completed on a quarterly basis moving
forward.
·
Customer services offer assistance to the public with
installing and setting up the ParkMate app. Current data shows that uptake of
the app is steadily increasing. Council officers confirmed that a breakdown of
the ParkMate user data can be provided to Councillors following the meeting.
·
Coins will remain as a payment option at parking meters for
those that do not wish to or are unable to use the app.
Committee's recommendation

Committee:
