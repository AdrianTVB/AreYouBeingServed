6.
Philippa Wood -
research student from Massey University
(Document 19/771) (Three documents
circulated at meeting)
Philippa
Wood addressed the meeting and circulated three documents – A letter,
dated 13 March 2019, from Ms Wood to the Chief Executive (part
CG-14-33-00157); an A4 information sheet containing the protocols and
procedures relating to the study (part CG-14-33-00157); as well as another
A4 information sheet setting out some background regarding her study (CG-14-33-00158).
Ms Wood
expanded on the points in the information sheets, explaining how she proposed
to undertake her study and how the results of the interviews would be
included in a reference document.  She advised that she would need to
read out the questions rather than circulating written copies of her questions.
Ms Wood
advised that there was flexibility regarding timing of the interviews as long
as they were undertaken over the next few months this year.  She
preferred to undertake the interviews on weekends as she would need to travel
here, but would consider the suggestions that the interviews could be
undertaken via skype and that more than one person could be interviewed at
one time.
Ondre Hapuku-Lambert/Eva

A)
That the
report of the Youth Development Co-ordinator titled “Philippa Wood
– Research Student from Massey University” dated 7 August 2019 be

August 2019 - Report on Hastings District Youth
Council Activities
(Document 19/758)
Louis Gaffaney gave a brief report on the
visit to the National Aquarium in Napier on Monday, 5 August 2019 and that
staff there had asked Youth Council (YC) members for ideas for the expansion
of the aquarium and ideas to attract more visitors.
Councillor Dixon suggested that the YC
members consider applying to the Eastern and Central Community Trust for
funding for some of the work to be undertaken at Albert Square – e.g.
for equipment.
Albert Square
– The Youth Development Coordinator, Ang Hughes, passed on information
she had been given from Council’s Public Spaces Planning Manager,
Rachel Stuart, regarding an update on the progress of the development and
some of the changes that had been made to the original brief.  Ang
advised that there had been a lot of changes to how the space would be used
and who would be involved in those discussions.
Breakfast
next week in Havelock North at 7.30am – YC members had to register by
Friday, 9 August.  Sophie Jones would send an RSVP from the YC as a
group.  She would also message Janicka Tei and Oscar Malpas to see if
they were attending.
“Talk
Like a Pirate Day” on 19 September – Charliot Miller asked
whether a letter had been sent out to local primary and intermediate schools
to explain what was planned and that it was in support of Canteen.  Kate
Allen and Gurjas Sekhon would work together to write that letter to go to
schools and be the project leads for this event.
Ang Hughes
reported that she had talked to the Suicide Prevention Fusion Group about
holding workshops at schools to help young people learn how talk to others
who were having problems and needed support.  Ang has given information
and feedback to the Group and is waiting for a further update – it was
suggested that Girls High; Lindisfarne College; Havelock North High and
possibly Karamu High School could be involved with these workshops.
Quiz Night
– it was agreed that this event needed to be held sooner than the
originally scheduled date of Friday, 27 September.  The date of
Saturday, 14 September was agreed on.  The project leads would be
Kate Allen; Charliot Miller and Eva Harper.  It was proposed to be held
at Karamu High School – Kate Allen and Sophie Jones to ask permission
for this event to be held at the school.
World Food
Day on 16 October (partnered with the Multicultural Assn) – Boston
Wynyard and Ondre Hapuku-Lambert to follow up in regard to this event.
It was suggested that a food market be held in Albert Square.
Halloween
event on 31 October – discussion took place regarding the suggested use
of the Hastings Art Gallery for an event, but in the end the YC decided that
they would not have enough time to put into the preparations needed - due to
mock exams coming up.
Youth Potential Awards on Monday, 19
August – Team Leader Youth Development, Paddy Steffert, and the Youth Development Coordinator, Ang
Hughes, updated the meeting on this event.  It would be held at Waipatu
Marae with a pōhiri before the main event for a
special guest at the awards.  The awards were starting at 5.00pm and the
YC members were asked to be there no later than 4.30pm (until 7.00pm) to
welcome people attending.
YC members to let Ang Hughes know (by
Monday, 12 August) if they can attend – need to wear school uniform and
badges.  Ang will organise transport for those members who need it
– parking is at the Tamatea Club rooms, not at the Marae itself.
25 young people were being acknowledged at the awards.  Ang will send
out information in an email to members and that will also go onto the group
chat.
Ang Hughes advised that the
Council’s Youth Strategy would need to be reviewed over the next few
weeks – she would bring brain dump information out to schools before
the end of this term and this would need to be addressed at the schools in
lunchtimes.  She asked that the YC members at the respective schools
help her when she visited their school.  Zeal now had a hub in the
Hastings CBD.
Kathleen Steffert/Boston Wynyard
A)      That
the report of the Youth Development Co-ordinator titled “August
2019 - Report on Hastings District Youth Council Activities”
dated 7/08/2019 be received.
