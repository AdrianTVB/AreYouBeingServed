considering the verbal submissions.
1.00pm Terry
Hickling, Wairoa Disability Trust (sub19)  Only Public Transport service available from
Wairoa to Hastings is by Wairoa Disability Transport Service.  Keen to
keep the service and would like HBRC to assist with operational costs
including driver wages.
1.15pm Gary Neems
(sub24):  Aim to reduce
number of cars on the road and encourage people to use public transport
services.  No seating at bus stops for senior citizens discourages use
so consideration needs to be given to seating and shelters throughout the
cities.
General discussions about
submissions.

Peacock, Central Hawke’s Bay (sub26)8:  Require a bus service in CHB, ideally including Takapau,
Waipukurau, Waipawa and Otane, then possibly expanded to include Ongaonga and

2.00pm Ron Wilkins
(sub27):  Strongly
believe that the 10.55am bus service #17 Parkvale/Akina needs to be
reinstated.  Also extend all service for senior gold card holders until
3.30pm, and introduce a new service between Hastings and Napier via Clive running
at 9.30am, 11.30am and 1.30pm.
2.15pm Jude
Henderson, Napier Disability Advisory Group (sub23):  Huge time constraints, including access
and costs, for disabled people using public transport.  Suggests colour
coded busses and or signs for disabled people to easily identify busses. Suggests
a concession fare for people with disbailities.
2.30pm Andrew
Lessells, Younited Students Assn (EIT) (sub32):  represent 11,000 EIT students and wants public transport
to be a viable alternative.  Bus travel times are too slow, recommends a
Flaxmere to EIT service and that timetables synchronise with EIT class
times.  Willing to engage to investigate possible solutions including
further student discounts.
2.50pm Shari
Tidswell, HB DHB (sub33):  Public transport reduces pressure on parking and road networks and infrastructure
costs.  It also increases road safety and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
3.05pm Cr Simon
Nixon, Hastings District Council (sub36):  Supports the RLTP in principle and suggests ways to
improve journey times, including a review of all bus services.  Strongly
supports promotion of commuter
concession fares and improved service between Flaxmere and EIT and
diverstions through Whakatu.  Suggests connections include sports park, Whakatu,
Haumoana, Te Awanga, airport connection and Hastings CBD shuttles plus
consideration of on-demand services.
