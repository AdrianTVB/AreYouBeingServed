Aquatic Centre Development: Completing LTP Caveats

& Recreation
1.1   Purpose
of Report
The purpose of this report is to
fulfil the requirements of the four caveats to the LTP decision to proceed with
the development of the “Pools & Play” option at Prebensen
Drive.
At the Meeting
The following points were raised during the discussion
on this item:
·
Managing the costs of this project is a very high priority. A
further $3M to the LTP provisions has been allowed for to provide some
flexibility in recognition of the shifting construction market; this has not
been formalised in future years at this point as it remains to be seen what
bids are received from any tendering process.
·
Some Councillors indicated strong concerns with regards to the
affordability of the project, when considered against a number of other large
pieces of work due to be undertaken.
·
These Councillors also suggested that some cost figures
provided (such as for the Onekawa site development) may be inadequate for the
works required.
·
A full contamination survey has been undertaken for the
Prebensen site and no issues were identified.
·
In regards to geotechnical considerations, the Prebensen site
is no worse than the Onekawa site. The Design-Build contractor will also
undertake their own further geotechnical assessments, and will take all
factors, including the water table level, into account in the design of
foundations and excavation.
·
The critical success factors were developed in discussion with
Council, and emphasis placed on accessibility and “value for
money” based on the clear feedback from elected members.
·
The Onekawa Park Working Group has not yet been established;
Terms of Reference will be drafted and membership confirmed at the
appropriate time in the wider project.
·
The list of people that will be engaged with in regards to the
Onekawa Park development is indicative only at this point, and is not
exhaustive.
·
The project as a whole has been taken to the Māori
Consultative Committee on several occasions.
·
It was reiterated that the decision in front of the Committee
is whether to proceed to tender, not which site to use as that decision has
already been taken; tenders will be brought back to Council, at which point
Council can assess the costs which will have been refined through the tender
process.
·
Aquatic facilities have been the number one concern raised in
the community surveys over several years.
·
Although some councillors felt that the decision should be left
until after the election, others noted that it is this Council that has
received all the information, that has participated in the workshops and that
has made the decisions to date, and it was important to continue to take
ownership of the project.
Officers will confirm whether the $500K budgeted for
the demolition of the buildings at the Onekawa site allows for any management
of contamination required.
Officers will provide an outline of Council’s
anticipated debt levels against comparable other Councils.
Deputy Mayor White proposed a minor amendment to the
Officer’s recommendation, which as it was supported by the seconder to
the motion, was captured as part c to the Committee’s recommendation.
Officer’s Recommendation
That the Strategy and Infrastructure
Committee:
a.     Note that
three of the four caveats outlined during the Long Term Plan deliberations in
relation to proceeding with the Aquatic Centre project have been completed:
i.      Caveat
#1: Post-move development and funding plan put in place for Onekawa Park has
been met by the Onekawa Park Development and Funding Plan.
ii.     Caveat
#2: Outdoor space built-in to the new complex has been meet by the design
concepts included in the ‘Napier Aquatic Centre Concept Design Revision
3.0’.
iii.    Caveat #4: The site investigations for the new location being
completed has been met by the Tonkin and Taylor report (Proposed
Napier Aquatic Centre, Prebensen Drive, Napier).
b.     Endorse

in this report.  This will complete Caveat #3: Scope for Tender agreed
by Council before it is tendered.
