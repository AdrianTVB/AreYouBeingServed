Verbal Update on Current Issues – HBRC Chair/CE
Rex Graham and James Palmer updated the
Committee, highlighting:
·
Council has voted to progress a minority share
float in Napier Port, appointed two directors to the Napier Port board, one
being Cr Rick Barker due to his extensive experience and strong union
background. Council is very focussed on offering everyone in the region an
opportunity to own shares through a preferential offer, and several meetings
with Chairs of all the Treaty Claimant Groups and Taiwhenua have been held to
gauge interest. Council’s final decision to proceed or not will be made
26 June.
·
A certificate of appreciation for Environmental Leadership in Land Management – Te
Hautūtanga Taiao me te Whakahaere Whenua was
presented to Jill Snelling who was being recognised
for her work to enhance the natural biodiversity of her land on Mangapoike Road near Wairoa, putting it
into QEII covenants and carrying on her mother’s work. These awards are very important to recognise those who contribute
to the environment
·
RPC meetings have been particularly
challenging for councillors and a number of workshops on working
collaboratively and building better relationships have been held.
·
The future and what the Māori Committee might look like going
forward is to be the subject of discussions over the coming months.
·
The TANK (acronym for the Tūtaekuri, Ahuriri, Ngaruroro and
Karamu river catchments) Plan Change is nearing the notification (for public
consultation) stage, which will commence with RPC adoption of the proposed
plan on 3 July. The TANK stakeholder Group is a collaborative group and made
up of approximately 30 representatives from agricultural, horticultural and
public health sectors, environmental and community interest groups, regional
and district councils and tangata whenua.
·
The next plan change process to be embarked on
is Mohaka Plan Change – RPC, including councillors, met with Ngati
Pahauwera on 17 April to hear their objectives for the plan change and to
start to build a strong partnership. Mohaka Plan Change will be complex as the
many challenges include erosion, the Wairoa River and its complexities,
wastewater issues and many more. Aiming to have to have this completed within
the next 2 years. In the interim, staff hope to complete the Wairoa Catchment
Plan
·
Central Government is investigating options to
improve the management of drinking, stormwater and wastewater (Three Waters)
to better support New Zealand’s prosperity, health, safety and environment;
working closely with councils, iwi and stakeholders to develop options and
recommendations. Hawke’s Bay currently facing challenges throughout the
region, facing ageing infrastructure and the level of investment required
exceeding the ability of communities to fund them, particularly smaller
communities. Brian Gregory advised he attended a hui in Porangahau a week ago
and the question arose as to when HBRC will repair the water supply and
sewage in Porangahau. Regional Chief Executives are working with consultants
to finalise and report “where to from here” options for councils
to consider and due to elections, newly elected councils will have to make
the decisions on how to proceed. The report from CEs will be made publically
available and will be presented to the next available Māori Committee meeting.
·
TANK plan change pre-consultation has been
held and received strong and diverse feedback.
·
Council had a plan effectiveness review carried
out on the Regional Resource Management Plan and Regional Coastal Environment
Plan, and the report on outcomes from the review will be presented to the RPC.
·
Current focus for Council’s Science team
is on producing the 5 year “State of the Environment” report on
trends and changes in the environment over the last 5 years as evidenced
through the data they’ve collected. The report will be released at the
end of this year and will be presented to the Māori  Committee.
·
The Pollution Hotline has received over 200+
call-outs through in the last quarter, predominantly on air quality, fires in
the Heretaunga zones, and odour (from Te Mata Mushrooms).
·
Currently processing 11 resource consent
applications with the most significant being the Wairoa District
Council’s wastewater consent application.
·
On Monday, 11 June, Central Government will be
announcing the Provincial Growth Fund applications and Hawke’s Bay is hoping
to receive significant funding, including for water security projects.
·
HBRC currently in discussions with Wairoa
District Council about Regional Park concepts and hopeful there will be
Central Government funding available to assist with costs
·
Draft 2019-20 annual plan will be presented to
the Corporate and Strategic Committee meeting tomorrow, 5 June, for feedback
and recommendation to Council for adoption.
·
Experienced some delays during this financial
year due to lack of skilled staff to do the work. Erosion Control Grant
Scheme (ECS) received 50 applications so far, totalling approximately $2.58 million
over 3 years. Council is continuing to build its workforce and hopeful to
have opportunities for local providers, specifically tangata whenua, to get
his work done.
·
After 6 years, the Napier to Wairoa rail line
will be re-opened on Friday, 14 June – as a result of Council’s
first successful Provincial Growth Fund application. Council fully expects
logs will be transported on the line before the end of 2019.
·
Some progress has been made on the Outstanding
Water Bodies (OWB) plan change, with the RPC recommending the adoption of the
proposed list of water bodies for pre-notification consultation process with the
proviso that staff will work with tangata whenua to flesh out any
cultural/spiritual values information gaps. Water bodies with ecological, wildlife
and other values were agreed upon and that all aquifers are included on the
list. Water bodies were identified for values that clearly “stand
out” and are “superior" when compared to the other water
bodies and are consistently identified as “outstanding” in
published literature. In response to a query, James explained that the
National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management, set by Central
Government, requires Council to identify and protect the significant values
of Outstanding Water Bodies.
·
The historical Ferry Hotel building is in
danger of being eroded by water and discussions with the owners are pursuing
durable solutions. Chris Dolley will provide an update at the August Māori Committee meeting.
MC24/19
Resolution

Update on Current Issues by the HBRC Chair” report.

Consented Discharges to the Marine
Environment
The Chair introduced the item and Liz Lambert spoke to it,
particularly around the Wairoa District Council and Affco meat processing plant
discharges. Discussions covered:
·
Item originally written as an overview of the major discharges
into the sea and coastal areas and how those consents are performing in terms
of compliance
·
Wairoa and Affco discharges are currently significantly
non-compliant, and HBRC has taken enforcement action against both in the past
·
WDC sewage discharged at same point since 1980s and the resource
consent issued in 1999 expired on 31 May 2019.
·
A replacement consent application has been lodged and it will
be publically notified and open for public submissions, with submission
Hearings to be held in Wairoa.
·
WDC has proposed, as part of their application, to look into
long term solutions to discharge to land, while continuing to discharge into
the Wairoa River in the short to medium term.
·
Regional Council very concerned about the slow progress with
this but recognise that financial constraints are restricting quick
solutions.
·
Ongoing issues include an unconsented discharge from an
overflow pipe into the Wairoa river, discharges outside the tidal times,
exceedances of Chemical
Oxygen Demand (COD) and Total suspended solids (TSS) limits as well as
failure to carry out follow-up sampling and investigations.
·
HBRC has issued an abatement notice to cease the discharge by
the end of October 2019.
·
An application for the discharge from the overflow pipe was
lodged prior to the replacement consent application and has been integrated
into it.
·
A number of significant non-compliance incidents in relation to
the Affco stock yard runoff – which should be captured and discharged
via the waste treatment and discharge system but was observed being discharged
via the stormwater system. HBRC has given Affco until the end of June 2019 to
resolve the non-compliant issues and will take further action if
non-compliance continues.
·
PanPac at Whirinaki has been compliant with its resource
consent conditions over the past year except for the failure of the outfall
pipe, which developed a crack at the land sea edge and was leaking treated
wastewater. PanPac is in the process of repairing this.
·
Queries in relation to “Pickering’s Funeral
Services” discharge into Wairoa River and the Wairoa District Council benthic
survey of the discharge outfall area (Shade Smith) to be followed up.
MC25/19

·
An enquiry and concerns raised from a member of
the community around Lake Whakaki and the topic “Sunshine, wetlands and
bees will revitalise the taonga of Whakaki”.
·
The community spoke on this matter and feel
excluded from the process as they have asked numerous questions on this matter
and “never gets an answer” or response.
·
Concerns is around planting manuka trees around
the lake to attract bees and promote honey production, which effectively
attract businesses to the lake.
·
The community would like to gain more
information on this project.
·
Nathan Heath responded that this proposed $3
million, 6 year project has been a significant body of work for a number of
staff within HBRC and the wider Whakaki catchment community and is currently
being revised and re-submitted to the Minister for the Environment for
consideration for funding.
·
The project is proposing a comprehensive work
program which includes the installation of a weir, the construction of a
recirculating wetland, the exclusion of stock and the planting of 10,000 native
plants along the Rahui Channel, Whakaki School refurbishment and enhanced
monitoring, weed and predator control.
·
Numerous consultation and multiple meetings and
discussions have been held with the community over the last 18 months.
Council will continue to engage with
tangata whenua.

Statutory Advocacy Update
The paper was taken as read, but
highlighted the paper focusses on resource management-related proposals upon
which the Regional Council has an opportunity to make comments or to lodge a
submission. Further discussions traversed:
·
The Central Hawke’s Bay and Napier City
District Plans are very important documents which are providing information
to HBRC.
·
