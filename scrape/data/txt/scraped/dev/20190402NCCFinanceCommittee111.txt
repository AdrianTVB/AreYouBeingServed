1.1   Purpose
of Report
To receive the half year report
to shareholders from Hawke’s Bay Airport Limited to 31 December 2018.
At the Meeting
Representatives of the Hawke’s Bay Airport Ltd
provided a presentation on the half yearly report to stakeholders –
please see Appendix One.
The following further points were made in response to
questions from Councillors:
·
Passenger numbers have been climbing steadily even prior to Air
New Zealand’s announcement regarding lower price points for some
flights.
·
With second tier providers also joining the market there may be
opportunities for different routes to be explored. Conversation is also
underway with Air New Zealand and Jetstar as well as Christchurch airport to
gain a better understanding of possibilities as to route expansion and
diversification opportunities.
·
Although it is expected that any noise impacts would be more
affected by increased fleet movements than by a change in fleet models, a
full review of noise contours is scheduled to be undertaken.
·
Car rental stand concessions have been increased following a
review of national rates (in August 2018) which indicated that Hawke’s
Bay was very low in the range.
·
Better visibility of available car parking is expected to be a
further flow on effect of the upcoming changes to the entrance and exit paths
from the facility.
The Airport team were thanked for their swift and
effective response in addressing the Voluntary Administration scenario.

Report for the six months ended 31 December 2018

Financial Officer
3.1   Purpose
of Report
To consider the Quarterly Report
for the six months ended 31 December 2018.
At the Meeting
The Chief Financial Officer spoke briefly to the
report, noting that there have been some changes to the designs in the
Parklands development for better environmental outcomes which have led to
slower sales in the previous quarter.
In response to questions from Councillors it was
advised that it’s difficult to quantify whether the option to have two
storey builds has had any adverse effect on sales. It’s possible that
there could be other more effective ways to market the options also.
The increase in reporting on water clarity issues may
be due both to the effect of operational changes that were underway in
December 2018, and also the improvements in capturing live data in relation
to service requests.
Should a Health and Safety incident occur when the
public are using a Council facility the Health and Safety team investigate,
and liaise with the appropriate business unit in addressing any issues. Due
to the nature of incidents these are addressed on a case by case basis rather
than a “one size fits all” approach.
A review into the MTG was recently undertaken,
following which the Working Group will bring suggested reporting measures back
to Council as part of a proposed management plan.
Officer’s will respond separately to questions
regarding the targets for Par 2 Golf, the Aquarium and MTG being lower than
last year’s achieved levels, and the three Resource Consent application
which missed their processing time.
