The following plans/maps were displayed and addressed

Senior

Requiring Authority (HDC).  He referred to the displayed Structure Plan
and highlighted the proposed roading location and other areas shown in the
legend on the plan.
He responded to
questions of clarification from the commissioner.
Legal
Counsel for the Requiring Authority, Ms A Davidson,

Order - K Cooper v Hastings District Council (55505#0355)

·       Copy of a noise assessment
for the "Howard Street Development Area - Submitter Concerns - Traffic
Noise Impact - Parkvale School” prepared by Malcolm Hunt, of Malcolm Hunt
Associates (55505#0357).
Ms Davidson
read her Outline of Submissions and addressed the other three items of evidence
at appropriate points during the presentation of her submissions.  She
displayed the track change version of the draft conditions, highlighting the
relevant points in response to submissions and / pre-circulated evidence
forwarded from the submitters prior to the hearing.  She responded to
questions and points of clarification sought by the commissioner.
Stormwater
Manager Mr M Kneebone’s Brief of Evidence on
behalf of the Requiring Authority (55505#0217) had been pre-circulated
prior to the hearing.  At the hearing he circulated and read his Summary
of Evidence (Stormwater Engineering Evidence), on behalf of the Requiring
Authority (55505#0358).  He circulated and referred to A3 colour
versions of the 21 sheets of cross-sections (55505#0281) which formed
part of the stormwater modelling work he had undertaken and had pre-circulated
prior to the hearing – as required by a number of directions issued by
the commissioner in the lead up to this hearing.
Mr Kneebone
responded to questions of clarification from the commissioner in regard to his
evidence.  He explained in detail the main differences between the three options
that had been extensively modelled, noting the effects that would result on
each of the submitter properties and advising why Option 3 was the preferred
scenario.  Mr Kneebone also referred to the earlier noted displayed Lidar
based flow arrow plan (ENV-9-19-3-19-230).
A point of clarification
was sought by submitter, Mr B Keane, with Mr Kneebone clarifying the route of
the proposed stormwater corridor once it reached the boundary with the Tremain
land to flow towards the Havelock Road.  He explained that the route
proposed through the Keane property was the most direct and effective route.
The
commissioner allowed Mr K Gee, who was a landowner in the immediate area but
who had not made a submission, to seek a point of clarification.
Mr Kneebone commented on the fall of the land and the direction of flow
and the ground levels that would result from the proposed NOR (as opposed to
the existing ground levels).
The
commissioner asked some questions of Mr Kneebone in regard to the modelling
work and supplementary evidence the latter had prepared and which had been
pre-circulated on 7 February 2019.
In response to
further questions of clarification sought by the commissioner, Mr Kneebone
explained there was a maximum difference of approximately 250mm in height
between Options 1 and 3, in regard to the finished ground level.  He also
addressed the change in level at the top of the cul-de-sac head; the Lidar
based flow arrow plan; the volumes of cut and fill required over the area; and
the need for a comprehensive development plan so that the work undertaken on
all the properties affected would result in consistency for the overall
stormwater system.
Transportation
Development Engineer, Mr S Kuruwita’s Brief
of Evidence on behalf of the Requiring Authority (55505#0216 and attachment
55505#0218) had been pre-circulated prior to the hearing.  At the
hearing Mr Kuruwita did not circulate any further evidence and was not asked
any questions by the commissioner.
Senior
Environmental Planner, Policy, Mr C Scott’s Brief
of Evidence on behalf of the Requiring Authority (55505#0215) had been
pre-circulated prior to the hearing.  At the hearing he circulated and
read his Summary of Evidence (Planning Evidence), on behalf of the Requiring
Authority (55505#0359).  Mr Scott responded to questions of
clarification from the commissioner in regard to his evidence.
Presentation
Of Submissions
Mr M Hill, General Manager for Trace Group who was appearing for TW
Property Holdings Limited made a verbal statement
on behalf of his client.  He confirmed support for Option 3 which had been
earlier outlined by Mr Kneebone.  Mr Hill explained that the reasoning
for seeking that the designation be split into two parts was to allow their
land to be developed for housing.
Expert Planning
evidence had also been pre-circulated on behalf of TW Property Holdings
Limited by Mr C Drury (55505#0295).  Mr Drury had been unable
to attend the rescheduled hearing and had advised that he was not able to commit
to being contactable to answer any questions the commissioner may have (55505#0307).
Mr J Ehlers,
an Engineer appearing for TW Property Holdings Limited addressed his pre-circulated engineering evidence (55505#0294).
Messrs J Ehlers and M Hill responded to questions from the
commissioner.
In response to questions
from the commissioner regarding roading levels, Mr Ehlers confirmed that
it would be helpful for his client to know the road level at their property.
Ms Davidson and
Mr Kneebone confirmed that the latter had started
work on long-sections that would clarify the roading levels across the extent
of the proposed NOR.  They confirmed that this information could be
presented as part of the reply submissions made by the Requiring Authority
later in the hearing process.
Mr A Hill,
Planning Consultant appearing for the Ministry of Education addressed his pre-circulated evidence (55505#0288).  He
advised that Mr A Dibley, Ministry of Education and Mr M Gifkins,
Principal of Parkvale School were also present at the hearing.
The
cross-section attachments to Mr A Hill’s pre-circulated evidence were
displayed and addressed at the hearing.  While he
noted that the Ministry supported the proposed NOR, Mr A Hill raised concerns
in regard to a number of issues illustrated in the attachments to that evidence
and sought a cross-section of what was proposed in order that some certainty
was provided.
The
commissioner asked Ms Davidson, on behalf of the Requiring Authority, to
address, in her Reply Submissions, the matter of a cross-section and the certainty
that had been raised by Mr A Hill.
Dr K Cooper circulated and addressed her Supplementary Submission (55505#0347).
She also tabled a copy of the Joint Memorandum of Counsel for Appellant
and Respondent regarding the Environment Court’s Consent Order, dated 8
February 2019 – K Cooper v Hastings District Council (55505#0364).
Dr Cooper supported
Option 3 and accepted the Council’s offer to “reference” the
area.  She responded to questions from the commissioner, including
clarification of the location of the “Plan K” roading corridor on
the displayed Structure Plan – which the commissioner noted was
“out of scope” at this hearing as this had been addressed by the
tabled Environment Court Consent Order. Dr Cooper withdrew her request to
reduce the width of the road and the condition for a noise mitigating fence.
Dr Cooper
sought reassurance that this roading corridor would remain in the agreed
location - as per the undertakings recorded in both the earlier Consent
Memorandum and the Draft Consent Order addressed by the Environment Court and
also supported and referred to in the evidence of Messrs Scott and Kneebone who
were appearing for the Requiring Authority.
Ms A
Arthur-Young of Russell McVeagh circulated and addressed her Legal Submissions (55505#0344) as
Legal Counsel appearing on
behalf of Woolworths New Zealand Ltd.  She responded to questions
from the commissioner, noting her client’s concerns regarding 1) the late
introduction of Option 3 along with the resultant uncertainty regarding having
a suitable corridor to convey and manage stormwater from all sites within the
Structure Plan area; and 2) the wording of the proposed conditions.
Ms Arthur-Young
advised that Mr B Nixon - Property Development Manager
for Woolworths New Zealand Ltd and Ms K Panther Knight, Consultant Planner were
also present.
Ms K Panther
Knight, Consultant Planner, Forme Planning -
appearing for Woolworths New Zealand Ltd, addressed her pre-circulated
evidence (55505#0293)
and referred to the proposed conditions which had been discussed prior to the
hearing with the Legal Counsel of the Requiring Authority.  She responded
to questions from the commissioner, agreeing that the earlier noted long
sections being prepared by the Requiring Authority would be an acceptable
approach to her client.
Mr B and Mrs
L Keane both addressed the hearing and made a
verbal statement.  They displayed and referred to four colour photos (55505#0314
to 55505#0317 and 55505#0365) and a short video (55505#0318).
Mr and Mrs Keane expressed their concerns regarding amendments they perceived
had been made to the TW Property Holdings Ltd site which meant it now drained
towards their property as opposed to draining towards Howard Street.
Mr Kneebone advised that this was not the case.
Mr and Mrs
Keane responded to questions from the commissioner, noting the cost they had
borne for work undertaken by a valuer.
Mr Keane sought
clarification regarding an alternative plan of Lidar based flow arrows which he
believed that he had seen which indicated a different direction of flow, from
the plan shown by Mr Kneebone – i.e. with a 45 degree angle of flow in
the top left corner of the plan.  Mr Kneebone advised that he had not seen
any such alternative plan for this area.
___________________________
The hearing adjourned for lunch at 1.12pm
and resumed at 2.05pm
___________________________
Senior
Environmental Planner - Consents, Mrs M Hart, the Council’s reporting
officer addressed the hearing.  She spoke to
her agenda report and its recommendations and also addressed issues that had
been raised, by each of the parties in turn, during the hearing.
Through the
commissioner, clarification was sought from the officers appearing for the
Requiring Authority.
·
It was
noted that any additional soil testing costs on the designated land would be
entirely covered by the Requiring Authority and there would be no cost to the
submitter or subsequent owner of the land, specifically in relation to the
designated corridor.
·
How could
the general public be prevented from using this parcel of land so it could be
solely used as an overland flow path for stormwater?
The meeting was
advised that a copy of the Public Notice was included on Agenda Page 24,
showing those landowners who were adjacent to or who were directly affected by
the NOR.
Mrs Hart
responded to questions from the commissioner.
The
commissioner directed the Legal Counsel for the Requiring Authority, Ms A
Davidson, to liaise with the representatives for Woolworths NZ Ltd in order
to attempt to resolve, or at least significantly
narrow, the differences between the parties regarding
the proposed conditions.  Ms Davidson was directed to file her written
Reply Submissions together with the proposed conditions by end of the day on Friday,
22 February 2019.
As noted
earlier, Mr Kneebone would produce long sections of the road and this would be
included with Ms Davidson’s Reply Submissions.
It was noted
that the Requiring Authority was not advocating the split designation so that
would not be addressed unless it was requested.
