Osmanthus Garden Lantern Festival Report
(Document 19/495)
Councillor Watkins had earlier declared a
potential conflict of interest in regard to this item being the organiser of
the festival.  He responded to questions, but took no part in discussion
or voting on this item.
Mayor Hazlehurst congratulated and thanked
Councillor Watkins for his work with the lantern festival, which was very
much on the events calendar for Hastings.  It was noted that the event
had grown in size, attendance by the local community was increasing and there
were plans to expand further in the future.  Councillor Watkins thanked
the Parks Team for their help in putting the lanterns in place.
There had been a diverse range of
cultures who attended this year, with good feedback being received by the HB
Multicultural Association.  It was suggested that an area be designated
at the back of the gardens so that people could enjoy a picnic tea.
Councillor Dixon/Ms R Latiff
A)        That
the report of the Democratic Support Manager titled “Osmanthus
Garden Lantern Festival Report” dated 14/05/2019
be received.
B)        That $9,000 be allocated from the 2019/20 International Advisory
Group’s budget to support the 2020 Lantern Festival.

Promoting Hastings to the Thailand Education Market
(Document 19/499)
Learning Hawke’s Bay, Wenhua Yang advised that
funding of $5,000 - $6,000   was required from Hawke’s Bay
Councils to promote Hastings to the Thailand education market.
It was noted that schools required the infrastructure to
support international students.  The higher the numbers of students attending
the more infrastructure that was required.  The local school rolls were
already full and there was no room for expansion to accommodate international
students.
Councillors would like to see where the funding was being
used and that Napier City Council would give an equal share to the programme
as most students were based in Napier.  Information was requested on the
number of International students in Hawke’s Bay and in which schools
they were placed.
Hastings District Council currently provides
administration support to Learning Hawke’s Bay and the Hawke’s Bay
Multicultural Association has been voluntarily working with them.
Councillor Dixon/Mayor Hazlehurst
A)
That the report of the Economic Development Manager
titled “Promoting Hastings to the Thailand Education Market”
dated 14/05/2019 be received.
B)
That the request for financial support not be granted at this
stage and that Wenhua Yang of Learning Hawke’s Bay provide further
statistics on the number of International students in the district and a budget
plan.
CARRIED
Wenhua Yang left the meeting at
4.06pm
