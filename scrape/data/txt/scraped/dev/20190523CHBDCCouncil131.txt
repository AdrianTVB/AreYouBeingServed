PURPOSE
The purpose of this report is to present to Council for
deliberation a management overview and issues identified since the adoption
of the Annual Plan Consultation Document and Supporting Information.
Recommendation
That having considered all matters raised in the
report:
a)   That

Against:           Crs
Alex Walker, Ian Sharp, Kelly Annand, Tim Aitken, Brent Muggeridge and
David Tennent
lost 2/6
Cr Tennent indicated his concern about the significant increases
being proposed and asked that each topic in the report be covered separately to
ensure clarity.
Topic One:  Three Waters compliance
Cr Annand sought clarification about how this would fit in with the
regional and national three waters reviews.  Officers confirmed that the
final report for the regional 3 waters review would be presented to regional Chief
Executives the week following the meeting and at that stage would be in a
better position to update elected members.
Cr Annand sought clarification about what the consequences would be
if the Council waited for an outcome from these reviews.  Officers
confirmed that there was a potential risk of prosecution and enforcement for
not meeting the required standards for water compliance.  It was also
confirmed that it was necessary to prepare budgets appropriately given the
length of time the programme would likely take to come to a resolution.
Cr Minehan asked whether other Councils  around the country found
themselves in a similar situation
Officers confirmed that this was a national issue.
Cr Muggeridge sought clarification about whether the Council could
defer any capex programmes to soften the rates impact.
Officers indicated that this was high risk because there had been a
number of projects previously deferred which needed doing.  It was also
raised that there had been clear feedback from the community that progressing
water projects was a priority.
Cr Sharp asked whether the Council could advocate to Central
Government to consider the impact continued regulation has on rates.
Mrs Davidson acknowledged that the reason the reform programme was
put in place was to address these affordability issues.
Topic two LiDAR:
Cr Sharp sought clarification on how funding was being split for
this project.
It was confirmed that Hawke’s Bay Regional Council had set
$300,000 in their LTP budget for year two.  Central Hawke’s Bay and
Wairoa District Councils were to pay $100,000 each and $550,000 was to be
shared between Napier City and Hastings District Councils.
Cr Tennent raised concerns about the regional split amounts.
Cr Sharp asked if the rating impact could be reduced by extending
the 5 year loan to a 20 year loan given benefit would continue into future.
Mrs Smith indicated that 10 years would be possible but that 20 years would be
too long a period of time to extend the loan for.
Cr Aitken sought clarification about whether any cost benefit
analysis had been done.
Officers confirmed that there would be significant benefit including
improved asset management modelling.
Topic three: Elected Member remuneration
Cr Minehan sought clarification about whether it was a legal
requirement to increase elected members’ remuneration amounts.  Officers
confirmed that it was a requirement through the Remuneration Authority
Determination and that the organisation was legally required to pay gazetted
amounts.
Topic four:  Community Trust Request for Funding
Cr Aitken sought clarification about why the trust could not seek
other ways of increasing its income.
Cr Sharp highlighted his support  for the facility and sought
clarification about whether the insurance included the stadium or just the
pool?  It was confirmed that the insurance was only for the pool complex.
Cr Burne-Field sought clarification about whether other funding
opportunities had been explored and whether the Council could offer insurance
for a lower price.
Officers confirmed that the trust currently had no other funding avenues
available to meet these costs.  Mrs Smith highlighted that the trust had
previously been part of Council’s insurance package but had sought to get
insurance independently.
Cr Sharp spoke to the motion that he would like to see some
increased transparency about the running of the community trust and the way it
functions.
Cr Aitken also requested that additional information was provided
regarding the CHB Community Trust’s finances.
Topic five:  Addressing Deficiencies in Council’s
Emergency Management Preparedness
Cr Aitken sought clarification about whether alternative technology
was available which would suit the purpose.  Officers confirmed that the cost
of alternative technology would not be viable.
Mrs Davidson also highlighted that this preparedness was necessary
to ensure business continuity to run the Emergency Operations Centre and still
be able to operate the Council’s business as usual.
Cr Burne-Field asked where the existing 27 radios in the district
were located and raised concern that there were only 7 across a wide area. Officers
confirmed that analysis had been undertaken which took into account the risk of
losing communication with key areas of the district.
Cr Annand sought clarification about regional versus district
emergency funding.
Officers confirmed that service delivery was a regional function and
cost but that local Councils are still legally required to provide base
infrastructure.
Cr Sharp sought clarification about what the ongoing servicing costs
be to keep up to date.  Officers confirmed that this had already been
budgeted for.
Topic Six Building Control Fees and Charges
Cr Tennent sought clarification about whether recovery rates would
change for consents.
Officers confirmed that they would not change.  However it was
noted that revenue targets were currently under budget and that the proposed
changes to the fees schedule could assist in meeting those targets.
Cr Burne-Field noted her objection to the inclusion of Topic 6 in
the motion.
Further discussion relating to motion:
Officers provided advice around what the implications would be of
deferring topic 1 – water compliance and topic 4 – CHB Community
trust funding in terms of striking the rates for the annual plan.  In
order for Councillors to receive the information needed to make a decision on
these items an extraordinary meeting would need to be called before the
adoption date of 20th June.
Meeting suspended 10.44am for morning tea
Meeting reconvened at 11.00am

MOTION
LOST
Motion
Moved:       Mayor
Alex Walker
Seconded:  Cr David Tennent
a)   That $250k from the rural reserve fund is tagged for
supporting water security initiatives in Central Hawke’s Bay.
b)   That council supports a collaborative approach at both a
local and regional level for development of water security initiatives.
c)   That council requests staff bring back a framework which
includes further information on the potential role of Central Hawke’s
Bay District Council together with Water Holdings CHB, HBRC and the Tukituki
taskforce, for understanding issues of water security and creating a local
package of solutions.
CARRIED
Cr Muggeridge highlighted that the $250,000
requested was money for research and development of water storage solutions,
not to build a dam.  He noted that Water Holdings CHB was simply a vehicle
for a water security conversation to take place.
Cr Aitken highlighted the benefit of
exploring options available and that a public/private partnership opportunity
would be needed to do this.  Cr Aitken was supportive of the Chief
Executive coming back with further reporting and the expected funding
milestones which would need to be demonstrated.
Cr Tennent agreed with the initial motion
from Mayor Walker about the impact of water security but raised concern with
the potential of revisiting the dam.
Mayor Walker raised that she would not
support the motion from Cr Muggeridge because of the need for a wider
conversation about water security and how it fits with other initiatives in the
district.
Mayor Walker provided an additional motion.
Speaking in support of this motion, Mayor
Walker highlighted that it was important to provide a funding platform which
would help conversations in the district to take place about what community
priorities are.  Mayor Walker raised that it was vital to address wide
community outcomes with the funding, not commercial outcomes.  She noted that
there was commitment and passion about water in the community and felt it was
important the community should have an opportunity to be considered and heard.
In seconding the motion, Cr Tennent raised
that this was an excellent way forward and acknowledged submitters who were concerned
about tying all funds in with one entity.  Cr Tennent raised the
importance of the Council demonstrating its desire to do something to address
the water security issue.  He also acknowledged Water Holdings CHB and
wanted to ensure they would be involved in ongoing discussions.
Cr Aitken and Cr Minehan spoke in support
of the motion given the broader view to explore other options.
Cr Burne-Field highlighted the importance
of building trust back in the community, given how divisive the issue of water
storage issue has been.  Cr Burne-Field raised some concern over the dollar
amount still being high but was in support of the motion.
Cr Sharp supported the motion and
acknowledged Water Holdings CHB for the role they had played in initiating the
conversation.
Cr Annand supported a collaborative
approach and raised the importance of maintaining momentum and action.
Mayor Walker acknowledged the importance of
community healing and about needing to move forward without being on opposite
sides of equation.  Mayor Walker also agreed with Cr Annand that there was
a need to be focussed to ensure some urgency around developing a framework.
Mayor Walker recognised of the value of the
leadership Water Holdings CHB had demonstrated by purchasing the IP for the
benefit of the community.  She highlighted that they were an important
partner in the framework but in a wider context.
Mayor Walker also thanked submitters for
their valuable input.

carried 5/2
Carried
Mayor Walker Sought clarification about what the rates impact would
be to develop a pound facility.
Officers confirmed that they were proposing no rates increase.
The first year would be debt funded and subsequent years be recovered in Animal
Control Fees and Charges.
Cr Burne-Field sought clarification about whether we had been asked
to vacate the current pound.
Officers confirmed that notice had been given that no ongoing
provisions would be made for a Council pound facility.
Cr Aitken sought clarification about numbers of dogs impounded each
year.
Officers confirmed that this was 25 in the 2nd quarter of
the financial year.
Cr Tennent moved the recommendation and spoke in support of the
motion, though raised concerns that MPI and the SPCA needed to be made aware of
the rating impact and the cost to the community.
Cr Aitken seconded the motion  but highlighted that he did so
reluctantly.  Cr Aitken and Cr Sharp both raised concerns about the
requirements from the Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) without
consideration given for how to fund them.
Cr Burne-Field asked whether another report could come back about
what the facility would actually look like and requested that a holding
facility was considered rather than full of facility.
Cr Minehan – agreed with Cr Burne-Field regarding a potential
holding facility.
Mayor Walker and Cr Annand sought clarification from officers about
what the implications would be for the Council if funding was not allocated.
Officers confirmed there were potential fines and exposure to Council being
prosecuted. It was raised that the reason for raising the issue at this time,
was to prevent further implications for next year’s Annual Plan.
Cr Annand spoke against the motion and requested that officers work
with SPCA to understand their strategic direction for Central Hawke’s
Bay.
Cr Sharp noted that Council’s decision had been forced by new
regulations and that the Council could be exposed to legal action so he was
forced to support the recommendation but wanted his objection noted.
Cr Aitken requested that the Mayor and Chief Executive write a
letter to SPCA and MPI stating the Council’s objections to the new
regulations.

Burne-Field
Seconded:  Cr
Brent Muggeridge
a)   That Council approve targeting external funding through the creation
of business cases to support investment in sealing to control dust by
reallocating $50,000 from existing carry forward budgets
b)   That
Council reprioritise $200,000 of the existing Land Transport budget/work
programme to contribute to sealing of roads to control dust if required.
Carried
Cr Tennent sought clarification about whether NZTA would look at
funding sealing of a road based on the number of houses the road services.
Officers confirmed that the NZTA criteria for dust suppression was
prescriptive and had previously not applied to particular roads in the district
needing to be sealed. However it was noted that if business cases were prepared
that there could be potential for some roads to be considered in the future.
Mayor Walker sought clarification about what the implications might
be if Council were to reprioritise land transport funds.  Officers
confirmed that this could mean that some work would be carried over to next year.
Cr Burne-Field moved both option 2 and option 4 from the
officer’s report.
Cr Muggeridge was in support of motion as it provided some ability
to progress a longstanding issue.
Cr Tennent raised concerns with reprioritising land transport
budgets given that some submitters to the Annual Plan had raised concerns about
the condition of rural roads.
Mayor Walker raised that the Long Term Plan may need to happen
earlier than planned due to Wastewater requirements.  Mayor Walker
indicated that this could provide scope to clearly outline expected levels of
service for land transport.
