1.1   Purpose
of Report
To provide the Audit and Risk
Committee (Committee) with an update on progress with risk management work and
to report on the highest paid risks.
At the Meeting
The Director Corporate Services spoke to the report
and provided an update regarding the current status of the Manager Business
Excellence and Transformation role. It was noted that risk reporting has not
advanced as planned due to the changes in this space and that Council has
also been holding off until a permanent appointment is made.
In response to questions, the following points were
clarified:
·
It was always intended that a dedicated resource would be
appointed to manage the risk programme.
·
Council officers’ would come back to the committee with
an update regarding the status of the Bluff Hill fence.
·
The purpose of the report incorrectly referred to the
‘highest paid risks’, this should read ‘highest
risks’.
·
It was agreed that Risk Management should be separated out from
the other High Risks as this should not be outside of Council’s
control.

Information

Reporting Officer/s &
Unit:
Sue Matkin, Manager People
& Capability
2.1   Purpose
of Report
The purpose of the report is to provide
the Audit and Risk Committee with an overview of the health and safety
performance as at 31 May 2019.
At the Meeting
The Manager People and Capability spoke to the report,
highlighting achievements for the period.  It was noted that work is
still required on near miss and hit reporting, and that Council will be
targeting staff without access to devices to ensure they are able to report
incidents as they occur. An overview was also provided of upcoming workshops
and programmes for Council staff.
In response to questions, the following points were
clarified:
·
The near miss and hit reporting target is shown as ‘more
than’ as Council wants to receive as many near misses as possible. This
is for reporting purposes to enable officers to start tracking trends and
manage potential incidents.
·
Internal audits are now well underway although Council will not
meet the target for this year. The focus has been on contractor audits and
ensuring contractors are set up for and using ‘SiteWise’ and
meeting other requirements.
·
A number of targets are already measurable for example, a
correlation could be made between the reduction in lost time injuries and the
number of pre-work assessments being completed.
·
It was noted that safety alerts have previously been used following
a significant incidents only; however, officers have questioned whether this
tool could be used to notify other incidents also to increase awareness.
