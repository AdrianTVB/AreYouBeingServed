Rating Invoice – Proposed Issue,
Due and Penalty Date Changes
Jessica Ellerm introduced the item, which proposes to change the rates
invoicing and penalty dates.  Discussions traversed:
·
The objective of moving the rating invoices is
to improve Council’s cash flow and recover Council income earlier as
well as remove the payment pressure on ratepayers
·
Opportunity to improve HBRC’s cash flow
through changing the date rates invoices are sent out and the date payment is
due
·
Currently rate invoices are sent out
mid-September and due 1 October each year, however Council allows ratepayers
until 31 January to pay before penalty is applied
·
Proposed to have one payment date only so that
the due date and final date for payment are the same.
·
Intention is for ratepayers to receive their
invoice 4-6 weeks before payment is due
·
changing rates invoice date previously raised
through efficiency review
·
Concern raised that the earlier due date will
add extra burden on the ratepayer
·
Legislation requires that the ratepayer
receives the invoice at least 14 days before the due date
·
previous suggestion to send out interim/part
invoices for on-time payments is not in the item
·
engagement to be done with 200 highest ratepayers
in each district and can allow two payment periods and/or flexibility around
payment options and potential remission of penalties for the implementation
year
·
A communications plan will be developed and
implemented once the Council adopts the proposal to allow plenty of lead in
time for ratepayers
·
changes to be implemented in the 2020-21
financial year

Proposed Schedule of 2019-2020
Internal Audits
Melissa des Landes introduced the item which proposes a schedule
of Internal Audits for the next financial year. Discussions covered:

Based on HBRC’s risk register, staff
recommend that internal audits are carried out on IT Security, Data
Analytics, Risk Management and Asset Management during the 2019-20 financial
year
·
Cyber security is an emerging risk for
organisations and councillors previously expressed an interest
·
Risk Management has evolved and developed over
the past two years and an internal audit will benchmark how effective
HBRC’s risk management processes are, along with areas for improvement
·
Review of Asset Management would include areas
such as the maturity of asset management controls, decision making, asset
performance and condition.
·
performance monitoring of climate change was
suggested for addition to the schedule and proposed to have a brief item on monitoring
HBRC’s current performance and progression, options and opportunities

Initial discussions held with Crown Horwarth who
will benchmark with their Australian partners and bring back a proposed initial
scope to the next Sub-committee meeting.
·
HR Practices listed as a low risk and will be
updated to the correct value as Melissa continues to engage with the Group
Manager Office of the Chair and Chief Executive to discuss changes required prior
to the next risk assessment update
·
scope of work for IT Security to include assessing
external vendors in relation to cyber security

Water Management Follow-up Internal
Audit Report
Liz Lambert introduced the item,
providing background on the initial Water Management Audit undertaken.  Discussions
traversed:
·
The audit focused on HBRC’s Water
Management and compliance processes and provided twelve recommendations
·
Based on the recommendations from the review,
Council has completed various tasks including development of a protocol of
responsibilities for TLAs and the District Health Board around drinking water.
·
Uncertainty as to where the Drinking Water
Group Joint Committee reports as currently no mechanism for the Joint
Committee to report to Regional Council
·
A further follow-up audit will formalise Joint
Committee report back as most appropriate, including frequency
·
the Executive Leadership Group receives
reports from the staff level Joint Working Group, where operational
activities are discussed and resolved
·
Many “partially implemented” recommendations
are reflective of the IRIS implementation, which went live end November 2018 with
some issues still requiring resolution through further software
implementation.
·
Council carries out compliance checks on TLA
drinking, storm and waste water consents and findings are reported back to
the respective TLA
·
Compliance reporting to Council is through the
Annual Compliance report, the quarterly Organisational Performance reports and
Significant Activities monthly reports to Council.
·
Three Waters Review remains a focus
·
significant discussions, decisions and
activities of the joint Drinking Water Group are reported to the HB Drinking
Water Governance Joint Committee
·
In relation to risk monitoring, the Compliance
Team is now resourced with one additional FTE allocated in 2018-19.
·
Concern raised that annual reporting from the
Drinking Water Group is too infrequent and suggested quarterly instead
·
Crowe Horwath to carry out a further audit of
issues not “closed”
·
Objection raised on restrictions and
limitations on Council set out in the Crowe Horwath document, and because
Council paid for the report it is up to Council how the report and the
information contained in it are used.
FIN114/19
Resolution
That the Finance, Audit and
Risk Sub-committee receives and notes the “Water Management
Follow-up Internal Audit Report” staff report and that Crowe Horwath be engaged for a further follow-up audit to
be undertaken within 6 months.

Financial reporting is subject to change with
carry forward requests going to the Corporate and Strategic Committee meeting
on 5 June.
·
Draft content of sections 1 and 2 was presented
to Council in an early March workshop, with a media release on 18 April signalling
Council’s non-consultation approach
·
proposed that a Schedule of variations to
budgets, as presented in the Long Term Plan feature in annual plan, similar
to the table on page 17 of the Agenda

Living Wage Update
The item was taken as read, with discussions traversing:
·
At the last FARS Committee meeting,
Councillors requested a cost analysis of implementing or referencing living
wage suppliers and how it could be implemented in the procurement
policy
·
Staff conducted a sample survey of direct
suppliers to determine likely impacts of requiring them to pay the Living
Wage, with feedback received disappointing
·
summary of the surveys is not enough to make
accurate enough assumptions or estimates to inform decision making
·
The Minister of Transport, Phil Twyford
announced 21 May that the Public Transport Operating Model Review (PTOM),
which the GoBus contract falls under, is now being reformed.
·
Highlights from the review and research recognise
that chronic understaffing in the bus industry is likely caused by poor wages
and working conditions
·
Staff will continue to monitor progress of the
reform and report to this committee
·
Council currently engaging with all five local
authorities to progress a discussion on determining a living wage for
Hawke’s Bay
·
Central Government has lifted minimum wage to
$17.70 per hour from 1 April 2019 and intends to increase it to $20/ hour by
2021.
·
an option may be to encourage the payment of the
living wage as opposed to making it a minimum requirement
·
Staff are not recommending a set weighting and
believe that each contract should be considered on a case by case basis
·
current Living Wage weighting contained in the
Policy under the Evaluation of the contract
·
once the HB living wage has been determined,
Council can determine whether to proceed with a more formal policy
·
Council pays Living Wage to all staff except
students.
·
Proposed that Council give preference to
suppliers who pay the Living Wage
