Airborne
Electromagnetic (SkyTEM) Surveys of Hawke's Bay Aquifer
Systems
Iain Maxwell
introduced the item, which explains what SkyTEM is and the scope and expected
outcomes of the survey, before Dr Jeff Smith gave an update on the project.
Discussions traversed:
·
The business case proposing the airborne electromagnetic surveys of Hawke’s Bay’s
major aquifer systems was put to Council during the development of the
2018-28 Long Term Plan

high resolution geophysical datasets from the surveys will significantly advance Council’s ability to
holistically image and characterise major aquifers at system-wide scales and
depths, for use to update our groundwater models to
better understand groundwater – surface water interactions and inform
nutrient models

FAQs and public messaging are part of the
communications plan associated with the project

left the meeting at 12.32pm.

surveys has been approved and accepted ($2.154M) and GNS has committed $300,000 of
co-funding resulting in a total of $4.3million being made available for this
project
·
SkyTEM surveys will provide precise 3D
hydrogeological models for the entire aquifer systems and will greatly
improve conceptual understanding of the aquifer systems and variability of
aquifer properties and where threats to the aquifers exist
·
The surveys will not provide groundwater
volumes in aquifers, although it may enable improved estimates
Cr Fenton Wilson returned to the meeting at 12.39pm.
·
Sea level rise and the potential for saltwater
intrusion into the Heretaunga aquifer
