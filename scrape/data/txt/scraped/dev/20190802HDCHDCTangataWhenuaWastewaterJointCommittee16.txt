Tangata Whenua Appointment Process to the HDC:
Tangata Whenua Wastewater Joint Committee
(Document 19/744)
The purpose of the report was to discuss the
appropriate appointment process for appointing Tangata Whenua representatives
to the Committee and nominations of individuals.
Under the provisions of condition 29 of
the Hastings District Council’s Wastewater Discharge Consent granted on
25 June 2014 Council was required to establish and maintain a Committee.
A Workshop was held on 28 June 2019  in regard to the process
of tangata whenua appointments to the HDC: Tangata Whenua Wastewater Joint Committee
and the following was agreed:
The two Post Settlement Governance
Entitles be responsible for their respective appointments to the Committee;
three from Heretaunga Tamatea Settlement Trust (given that the main
jurisdiction and demographic resides within HTST) and two from Mana Ahuriri
Trust.
·
With the two current vacancies, the HTST
through Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga have put forward Marei Apatu and Beverley
Te Huia to be appointed as Tangata Whenua representatives on the HDC: Tangata
Whenua Wastewater Joint Committee. Both nominated appointees have the
necessary skills, attributes and capacity to participate on the Committee and
fulfil the necessary obligations and responsibilities.
·
The size of the Committee would see the status
quo remain being five Councillors and five Tangata Whenua representatives.
·
The term of office on the Committee would also
support the status quo where Councillors would be appointed at the beginning
of a new triennium.
·
The Terms of Reference for the HDC: Tangata
Whenua Wastewater Joint Committee shall be subject to review by the Joint
Committee at its first meeting following each local government triennial
election.
Resignation - Mr Paku advised the meeting that with the new process for
appointment made he would be standing down from the Committee at the
conclusion of this meeting.
Mr Paku had been a member of the Committee since its inception in 2000.  The Committee was
unique at that time as it brought together Māori and Council
representatives to work on Hastings’ wastewater treatment and disposal
policies together.  The integration of the two
cultural approaches had been significant which culminated in the development
of the Papatuanuku Channel renamed the
“Rakahore Channel” at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.
The Chair, Councillor Heaps on behalf of the Committee
acknowledged Mr Paku’s valuable contribution
from the inception of the Committee in 2000.  The Committee had been
fortunate to have someone of Mr Paku’s calibre to work with for the
last 19 years and had taught members all such a lot.
3 Waters Progress Update - The 3
Waters Services Manager, Mr Chapman advised that Government had approved
regulatory reforms to help ensure safe drinking
water, and deliver improved environmental outcomes from New Zealand’s
wastewater and stormwater systems.
A new dedicated water regulator would be established to oversee
the regulatory regime. The regulator would have a range of responsibilities
and functions, including standards setting; compliance, monitoring and
enforcement.
There will be national standards implemented in relation to wastewater
and stormwater.  Drinking water would be dealt with first.
Mr Chapman advised that in the next 24 months the Committee would
have to deal with a number of issues including a longer term vision in being
resilient to climate change at the location of the Wastewater Treatment
Plant.  Reducing waste and toxicity of waste at the point of generation
could be a beginning.
Ms
Huata-Kupa/Councillor Watkins
A)        That
the report of the Pou Ahurea Matua - Principal Advisor: Relationships,
Responsiveness and Heritage titled “Tangata Whenua Appointment
Process to the HDC: Tangata Whenua Wastewater Joint Committee”
dated 2/08/2019 be received.
B)        That moving forward, the two Post-Settlement Governance Entities
of Heretaunga Tamatea Settlement Trust and Mana Ahuriri Trust will be
responsible for appointing their respective nominations to the Committee.
C)        That Marei Apatu and Beverley Te Huia’s nominations be
accepted from Heretaunga Tamatea Development Trust as replacements for the
two current Tangata Whenua vacancies on the HDC : Tangata Whenua Wastewater
Joint Committee effective from 2 August 2019.
CARRIED
Councillor
Heaps/Ms Huata-Kupa
A)        That Mr Paku’s
resignation as member on the HDC : Tangata Whenua Wastewater Joint Committee
be accepted.
B)        That a nomination of
a tangata whenua representative from the Heretaunga Tamatea Settlement Trust to
replace Mr Paku will be considered at a future meeting.
CARRIED
Final Meeting as Chair - Councillor Lyons on behalf of the HDC Tangata Whenua Wastewater
Joint Committee and Council staff, thanked Councillor Heaps on his term as
Chair and membership over the past 15 years for his hard work, passion and
contribution on the Committee.
Councillor Lyons advised that Councillor Heaps was not standing
for re-election and this would be his last HDC Tangata Whenua Wastewater
Joint Committee meeting he would Chair.
