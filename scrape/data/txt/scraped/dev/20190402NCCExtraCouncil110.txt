Agenda
Items
1.    Kerbside
recyling collection
Type of Report:
Operational
Legal Reference:
Local
Government Act 2002
Document ID:
710714
Reporting Officer/s &
Unit:
Jon Kingsford, Director
Infrastructure Services
1.1   Purpose
of Report
To communicate to Council the
process officers are following to implement the kerbside recycling collection
as per the Joint Waste Management and Minimisation Plan (WMMP) adopted by
Council in September 2018, and to seek approval for the budget parameters to
enable officers to go to tender for an enhanced kerbside recycling collection
service based on the Joint Waste Management and Minimisation Plan (WMMP).
At the
meeting
The plastics recycling paper
taken to the Strategy and Infrastructure Committee in public excluded on 28
March 2019, and associated minutes, have since been released into the open
record and were tabled at this meeting as supporting information to this item
– see Appendix One.
The Chief Financial Officer noted
two corrections to the table on page 10 of the agenda:
·
The 2.2% rates figure for the 2019/20 part pay option for
consultation should be corrected to 1.4%
·
The 3.8% rates figure for the 2019/20 full pay option for
consultation should be corrected to 3%
The following points were made in
discussion:
·
The Joint Waste Futures Project Steering Committee is aware of
the risk in the recycling space and that Napier needs to go to tender as soon
as possible as part of mitigating that risk. It is recognised that the Waste
Management and Minimisation Plan (WMMP) is in many ways aspirational and may
take several phased steps to achieve.
·
The risk of the current contract has been balanced against the
benefits of a fully regional approach, and it is believed that the risk and
demands on the team are too high not to proceed to tender earlier than
Hastings District Council. All tender documentation will be available to
Hastings, and the waste contract to be tendered in 2020 will be a fully joint
process.
·
Although costs have risen at the transfer station in relation
to the transport of glass recyclables, it is not believed that there is a
reduction in the market for glass at this point.
·
Central Government return schemes tend to focus on types of
product rather than the material of the product.
·
Once Council has made a final decision on the collection of
plastic types 3-7 at its upcoming meeting scheduled for 16 April 2019, any
changes to the current process would require a communications and education
programme to be developed. It is anticipated that should any changes be made
these would be implemented mid-May 2019 at the earliest.
·
The communications plans around Napier’s changes would be
separate to those indicated in the WMMP but will be a joint approach with
Hastings to the extent possible.
·
All territorial authorities are allocated a proportion of the
national waste levy. Currently this is allocated to a waste management fund
intended to implement actions under the WMMP. Other funding from the levy
would only be available for novel ideas for waste minimisation.
·
The option to provide a pricing range to tenderers was
explored; it is believed that having a fully open tender will create the
desired level of competition for the tender.
·
It was asked that an internal Council-provided option be
further investigated as a long term option.
·
Previous examples of land banking recyclable materials have
resulted in contamination of the materials within a few years of collection.
It was also noted that collecting for landbanking purposes would increase
greater sorting costs.
·
The $95 is per rating property.
Council resolution
Councillors
Brosnan / Hague
That Council:
a.     Approve
the extension of the current temporary arrangement for the provision of
kerbside recycling collection service until a new service commences.
b.     Approve to
go to tender specifying outcomes sought through the contract and align with
the Waste Management and Minimisation Plan (WMMP) 2018-2024 in regards to
weekly collection and receptacle(s) provided, with a budget equivalent to
costs of up to $95 per annum for each ratepayer receiving the service
(including GST).
c.     Note that
Officers are working towards tendering for the kerbside recycling collection
service as outlined in the Joint Waste Management and Minimisation Plan
(WMMP) 2018-2024, for the contract to take effect as close to 1 November 2019
as possible.
d.     Note that
Council have a recommendation from the Strategy and Infrastructure Committee
to collect only Grades 1 and 2 plastics, thus discontinuing the collection of
plastics 3-7.
e.     Note
that Council will undertake consultation with the public as part of the
Annual Plan 2019/20 for the funding of the kerbside recycling collection
service and how it relates to the Joint Waste Management and Minimisation
Plan (WMMP) 2018-2024, based on the current estimated cost increases.
The consultation will include options on how the cost for ratepayers will be
phased in.

2.1   Purpose
of Report
To recommend the proposed
amendments to the Revenue and Financing Policy and the Rates Remission Policy
for adoption by Council and subsequent consultation with the community.
At the
meeting
In response to questions from
Councillors it was advised that these policies are being brought to Council
now to ensure that there is as much clarity and transparency as possible as
early as possible.
“Water by meter” is
considered a rate, and in practice there have been remissions of this rate,
but the policy did not previously cover this. The updated policy is intended
to clarify actual practice.

3.1   Purpose
of Report
To present the consultation
document and supporting information for the annual plan 2019/20 for
Council’s adoption.
At the
meeting
Some minor typographical
corrections identified in the consultation document were tabled. A
typographical correction in the report was noted – the Funding
Application Community meeting is currently scheduled for 29 May 2019, not 29
June.
The following updates to the
document were discussed:
·
The rates affordability parameters, and Council’s
internal borrowing levels will be stated in the consultation document
·
The image of Perfume Point has been transposed 180 degrees and
will be corrected
·
A total three waters figure could be provided in the
“what you get for your rates dollar” supporting document, with
the separate waters broken down underneath the total. There was comfort with
either this or the current presentation expressed.
It was noted that while there are
some challenges ahead for Council and it will be important to continue to
actively manage risks and opportunities, Napier is in a stronger starting
position financially than many Councils to manage these.
