1.1   Purpose
of Report
The purpose of this report is to
provide the rationale for the proposed fees and charges increases for Bay Skate
for the 2019/20 financial year.
At the Meeting
The Manager Sport and Recreation spoke to the report.
As part of the completed Bay Skate revenue review a list of strategies were
developed for implementation in the next year and a half, one of these is
proposed membership and rink hire price increases to reduce the likelihood of
a financial impact on rate payers. This needs to be balanced with the risk of
reduced membership as a result of price increases.
In response to questions from Councillors, the
following points were clarified:
·
Four months into the new financial year revenue at Bay Skate is
steadily growing. With no price increase the minimum target could be met;
although, revenue should ideally reach higher than the minimum target.
·
Bay Skate didn’t recover costs in the past financial year
due to unsuccessful outdoor movie events, also some ramps were unable to be
used for a significant period.
·
The rate increase will generate an extra $4000 over the
financial year.
·
The ‘Lick This’ ice cream shop’s rent is
income for Bay Skate.
·
The large flat area is mainly used on weekends by skate
boarders. The intention is to develop this space further.
·
The Napier Sharks use the Bay Skate facility for training. They
would struggle with a rent increase and the rink area would require upgrading
before an increased hire fee could be justified. Upgrading this area is in
the asset development plan.
·
Increase in prices may affect membership, but this is hard to
predict.
·
Bay Skate staff actively interact with customers to ascertain
what is working well at the facility and what would make it more attractive.
The Manager of Bay Skate is exploring ideas to generate more income, also to
make the facility more accessible to people with financial and physical
limitations.
·
A concession card with free entry’s for members is under
consideration and Council is partway through implementing at a joint sport
and recreation system between Bay Skate and the Aquatic Centre.
·
Once a plan is developed for birthday party events it will be
brought back to the Committee to review.
Following questions and discussion, Councillors agreed
that they were not prepared to increase the fees and charges at this time and
a substitute motion was proposed in order to reconsider the matter at a later
date.
It was noted that when this matter is brought back to
Committee, Councillors would like to see some modelling on how a reduction in
price per visit would impact on demand included in the report.
Officers’ recommendation
That the Finance Committee:
a.      Note
that the proposed fee increase are proposed as part of a wider piece of work
to increase revenue generated by Bay Skate and therefore minimise the impact
to ratepayers.
b.      Approve
the Bay Skate fees and charges increased as per the fees and charges
proposal.
Substitute Motion
Committee's recommendation
Councillors
Wright / Tapine
That the Finance Committee:
a.     Agree that
the proposed fee increases for Bay Skate are parked and reviewed again in eight months to a year’s time, as part of the next Annual
Plan, to ensure they are in line with the Financial Strategy.
