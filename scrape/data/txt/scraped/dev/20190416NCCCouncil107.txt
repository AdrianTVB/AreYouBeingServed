Aquatic Centre Development: Completing LTP Caveats
Type of Report:
Operational
Legal Reference:
N/A
Document ID:
711664
Reporting Officer/s &
Unit:
Glenn Lucas, Manager Sport
& Recreation
1.1   Purpose
of Report
The purpose of this report is to
fulfil the requirements of the four caveats to the LTP decision to proceed with
the development of the “Pools & Play” option at Prebensen
Drive.
At the meeting
The Manager Sport and
Recreation spoke to the report. He also provided an overview in relation to
the Equitable Access Plan being developed for this facility, and noted that
the important areas of focus for this work include location, sense of
belonging, cultural capability, programming partnering and continuing
community engagement and input.
In response to questions from
Councillors the following points were clarified:
·
At this time Council has not received any complaints in
relation to the aquatic centre from either the Office of the Ombudsman or the
Waitangi Tribunal.
·
The Equitable Access Plan currently being developed will provide
a framework that can be applied to other facilities in future.
·
A cultural impact study has not been completed on the site as
this is not required as part of the resource consent process.
·
Many of the 47 risk factors previously identified do apply to
both sites as they are related to project risks and not just the site. These
risks have been transferred to the Prebensen site where relevant.
·
Council officers have received written confirmation from the New
Zealand Transport Association advising that motorway designations will be
lifted from the Prebensen site.
·
Operational matters concerning the day-to-day utilisation of
the facility will be discussed at a later stage.
·
Traffic impact reports are currently being undertaken and the
results are not known at this time; however, they will be provided as part of
the resource consent application.
·
The proposed areas for expansion in the project fall outside of
the liquefaction risk areas.
·
$41.3Million has been approved for the project through the Long
Term Plan (LTP), not $50Million as reported. The cost of land is not normally
included in capital projects and the $3Million proposed to be set aside as a project
contingency due to the timing delay through the 2018 notice of motion has not
been approved at this time.
·
All statutory responsibilities and legislation requirements
have been met through the special consultative process under the LTP.
Council’s audit process ensures these are met also.
·
The Audit and Risk Committee provide an open forum for
discussion around risks. A seminar was also held with the Committee around
the LTP to assess risks and work through planned borrowing. No other risks
have been raised by the Committee in relation to this project.
Before opening the matter up
for discussion the Acting Mayor reiterated that the motion on the table is
about the scope of tender. It was noted that the Māori Consultative
Committee did not make any further recommendations to Council for
consideration on this matter.
Those in support of the motion
noted the following points:
·
The caveats in question have been completed and the scope of
tender includes everything required to meet the community’s needs.
·
The community are protected from cost increases. If the tender
comes in above budget Council can consider options. Until the tenders are
received the cost is unknown.
·
Significant opportunities are presented through the new
facility including looking at ways to deliver equitable access, local storytelling,
learn to swim programmes and the redevelopment of the Onekawa site.
·
The community is crying out for more aquatic facilities. The
biggest area of complaint for the city for several years has been the current
aquatic facilities.   The Onekawa aquatic centre is currently at
capacity with significant waiting lists for learn to swim programmes.
·
The affordability of this project has been assessed at many
stages throughout this process.
·
The Audit and Risk Committee have not raised any risks
regarding this project and the only risk remaining is in further delaying the
project. The proposed $3Million contingency is required due to the significant
delays to this project to date.
·
The community has been asking for better aquatic facilities for
the last 20 years.
·
Councillors should be able to trust the independent assurances
given to them around the affordability of this project. Council has not
deviated from the figures assessed by Audit New Zealand and provided to the
Audit and Risk Committee. The information provided to Councillors says that this
is affordable.
·
This is a 50 year plus facility and when you consider the
projected growth this location will be in the middle of the city in 50 years’
time.
Those against the motion noted
the following points:
·
The total cumulative rates increase for this project over the
next three years would be 5.6%.
·
There is concern around potential budget ‘blow outs’,
and whether that will mean having to reassess and cutting other elements from
the plans in order to reduce costs.
·
Some Councillors did not feel that the amount set aside will be
sufficient to complete the project and meet Council’s aspirational
goal.
·
The current forecast lending does not appear to include other
risks including social housing; Council has other risks that they need to set
funds aside for.
·
Only five schools out of 35 are close to the Prebensen site and
the lack of lane space still does not appear to have been sufficiently
addressed.
·
The overall rates affordability was discussed at length with
some Councillors expressing concerns as to the impact on ratepayers, specifically
those on fixed incomes.
In response to questions it
was clarified that standing orders (in line with the local Government Act
2002) provide for the Chair to have casting vote in the event of a split
decision.
