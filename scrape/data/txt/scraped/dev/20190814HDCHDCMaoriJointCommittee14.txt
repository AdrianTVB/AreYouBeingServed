Forum Item: - Bridge Pā Long Term Community
Plan and Global Haka Presentation by Wi Huata
(Document
19/756)
Bridge Pā Community Plan - Mr Huata updated the Committee on the Bridge Pā Community
Plan and outlined the approach has been to capture the history of Māori/Pākehā
at Bridge Pā and this was a different process to that normally
undertaken for Community Plans.
Mr Huata circulated four documents at the
meeting:
·
Bridge Pā Long Term Community Plan
- Project Summary (CG-14-14-00099)
·
Bridge Pā Long Term Community Plan
– Milestone Two Report (CG-14-14-00101)
·
Proposal to accelerate Marae Community Development (CG-14-14-00100)
The following recommendations were put
forwarded by Mr Huata which would be addressed by the Chief Executive and the
Pou Ahurea Matua - Principal Advisor: Relationships, Responsiveness and
Heritage:
1.     For HDC to facilitate a meeting with the Provincial
Growth Fund to look at a grant of $250,000 to fund a project management team
and to conduct a feasibility study for the Bridge Pā Sports Academy.
2.     For HDC to facilitate a meeting with Te Puni Kōkiri
for them to contribute to the Bridge Pā Community Plan (as was
promised).
3.     For HDC to umbrella the Bridge Pā Community
Plan initiatives that we will also take to MSD, TPK Whenua Fund, MPI 1BT Fund
and MBIE.
4.
For HDC to facilitate meetings
with HBRC that enables Māori landowners in Bridge Pā to irrigate
from their lands.
Global Haka – Mr Huata advised that it was intended to create and
develop a new iconic world-class Māori culture and cuisine wine event in
Hawke’s Bay in 2020.  The Global Haka would be a 6 day festive of
a diverse range of Māori cultural heritage and cuisine in the district.
To promote Hawke’s Bay as a must visit Māori cultural destination
uniquely different to Rotorua.
Circulated at the meeting was a
presentation on the Global Haka (CP-01-23-1-19-51).  This presentation
had been part of the Annual Plan submission on 4 June 2019.
It was anticipated that the event would
be held bi-annually at every alternate year to Te Matatini.
Concern regarding the commercialisation
of taonga – common theme how over the years something that whānau
could enjoy has turned to a lot of anger.
Mayor Hazlehurst withdrew at 2.14pm
and rejoined the meeting at 2.20pm.
Dr Graham to investigate the overall
picture of who has community plans and how can Council support what is in the
community plans and facilitate engagement of other agencies.

Appropriate
Appointment Process of Tangata Whenua Members to the HDC : Māori Joint
Committee
(Document 19/804)
The Pou Ahurea Matua - Principal Advisor:
Relationships, Responsiveness and Heritage, Dr Graham advised that the
purpose of the report was to obtain a decision from the Committee on the
appropriate appointment process of tangata whenua members to the Committee for
the incoming Council in November 2019.
The Committee felt that the Terms of
Reference were still relevant subject to a few minor amendments with respect
to the development and implementation of Te Kura Nui - The Māori
Responsiveness Framework, former initiatives that were no longer current, and
a membership of six tangata whenua and six elected members remain.
There was considerable discussion on the
original recommendation below regarding specific naming of the entities and
ensuring the continued engagement of mātaawaka and
Takitimu in the work of the HDC: Māori Joint Committee.
“That  tangata whenua appointees who represent each of
the six Post Settlement Governance Entities (PSGEs) (Heretaunga-Tamatea Settlement
Trust, Ngāti Pāhauwera Development Trust, Ngati Kahungunu Iwi
Incorporated, Hineuru Trust and Maungaharuru Tangitū Trust) from within
the Hastings district are to be nominated by the respective and Ngāti
entities”
Following discussion the meeting agreed
that an appointments panel comprising the incoming Mayor, the current chair
of the HDC: Māori Joint Committee, Council kaumātua and Chief
Executive be set up to consider applications or recommendations for tangata
whenua members who had the relevant knowledge, connections, skills, capacity
and time commitment to be a fully effective member of the HDC: Māori
Joint Committee.
Recommendations for appointments from
this panel would be put before the Council for approval at the inaugural
meeting of the new Council on 7 November 2019.
Mr Gilbert/Councillor Barber
A)     That the report
of the Pou Ahurea Matua - Principal Advisor: Relationships, Responsiveness
and Heritage titled “Māori Joint Committee Tangata Whenua
[Replacement] Membership” dated 22/05/2019 be received.
B)     That the HDC:
Māori Joint Committee recommends to the new 2019-2022 Council that the
HDC : Maori Joint Committee or its successor be set up as follows:
i)
That expressions of interest be sought for six tangata whenua
appointees who represent the Post Settlement Governance Entities (PSGEs) and
other groups, including mātaawaka from within the Hastings district to
be considered for appointment to the HDC : Māori Joint Committee or its
successor.
ii)
That six elected members be appointed by Council to the HDC :
Maori Joint Committee or its successor.
iii)
That the appended Terms of reference (CG-14-14-00096) be
adopted by the HDC: Māori Joint Committee or its successor.
iv)
That the Chief Executive be delegated authority and given
responsibility to set up and administer an Appointments Panel comprising the
incoming Mayor, the current chairman of the HDC: Māori Joint Committee
(Robin Hape), Council kaumātua, and Chief Executive to recommend to
Council suitable Tangata Whenua candidates for appointment to the HDC:
Māori Joint Committee or its successor.
C)     That
the Decision of the current Council to make appointments of members of the
HDC : Māori Joint Committee with full voting rights to Council Standing
Committees be strongly recommended to be continued by the incoming Council
for the 2019 - 2022 triennium.

thanked Committee members and Kaumātua for their participation,
contribution and work during the last three years.   It had been a
pleasure to share ideas and debate issues as part of the process to assist
Council to move forward although it had not been without trials and
tribulations.  Mr Hape said he thought that the Hastings District

inclusion of the cultural backdrop for development would only bring good
rewards.
