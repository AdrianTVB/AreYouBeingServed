Councillor Tom Belford Notice of
Motion: Potential Tukituki Plan Change
The Chairman invited Councillor Tom
Belford to move his motion, as presented in the recommendations, being:
3.     Agrees
that no further expenditure is to be made with respect to investigating or
progressing any amendment to PC6 unless/until authorised by future action of
Hawke’s Bay Regional Council and instructs staff to cease all
associated activity in this regard.
4.     Requests
that staff, relying on existing science programmes, continue to assist and
advise the Tukituki Water Taskforce with regard to:
4.1.   optimum
efficient and equitable use of surface and groundwater in Central
Hawke’s Bay reaches of the Tukituki River catchment; and
4.2.   options and
approaches for meeting the requirements of the Tukituki Plan Change (PC6) as
it stands.
The motion was seconded by Cr Paul
Bailey.
Points covered during discussion of the
motion included:
·
Basically puts the force of a resolution
behind the course of action that the Chief Executive has indicated he is
inclined to pursue and not expend any further effort to explore a limited
plan change
·
staff conducted a due process to assess the
feasibility of a limited plan change, resulting in a recommendation to the Regional
Planning Committee that no plan change is initiated, however for procedural reasons
the Committee did not resolve the item
·
Tukituki taskforce is developing a strategy
for water use in the catchment which is fair to all stakeholders and the
community will decide what equitable use is in CHB
·
The motion proposes to discontinue consideration
of the plan change before the RPC has had the opportunity to resolve the matter
because it remains ‘on the table’ and preempts what tangata
whenua may decide
·
strong opposition to the motion was expressed,
noting that the Tukituki Taskforce has had significantly less time to work
with the community than was afforded the TANK stakeholder group and a request
made for more time to engage with the community to find solutions and the way
forward
·
the motion itself does not preclude any
further investigation or engagement with the community, and formalises a
hiatus in the process which could potentially be reinvigorated through an RPC
recommendation to Council
RC20/19
Resolutions
That Hawke’s Bay Regional Council
1.     Receives and notes the “Councillor Tom Belford Notice of
Motion: Potential Tukituki Plan Change” staff report.
2.     Receives Councillor Tom Belford’s
Notice of Motion: Potential Tukituki Plan Change for consideration.
3.     Agrees
that no further expenditure is to be made with respect to investigating or
progressing any amendment to PC6 unless/until authorised by future action of
Hawke’s Bay Regional Council and instructs staff to cease all
associated activity in this regard.
4.     Requests
