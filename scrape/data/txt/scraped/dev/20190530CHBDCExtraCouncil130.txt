Section
Annual
Plan 3 Waters Compliance Additional Funding
PURPOSE
The matter for consideration by the Council is the
approval of additional funding required in the Annual Plan 2019/20 to support
regulated compliance work for the three waters.
Resolved:
19.42
Moved:       Cr Ian Sharp
Seconded:  Cr
David Tennent
That having considered all
matters raised in the report:
1)
Council approve the additional budget required in the
Annual Plan 2019/20 to support regulated compliance for the Three waters and
this is loan funded to a total value of $113, 191.
Carried
Cr Minehan sought clarification about whether we were currently meeting
drinking water standards and wondered as we progressed whether it was likely
that we would not be meeting future requirements.  The Chief executive
confirmed that what has changed are the standards for drinking water which
requires a refreshed approach to water safety plans.
Cr Burne-Field sought clarification on what planned asset management
planning work was already being done.  Officers confirmed that they were
preparing for the next Long Term Plan to remodel and redevelop asset management
plans to present to elected members.
Cr Burne-Field sought clarification on whether Stormwater asset
management planning included LiDAR costs.  It was confirmed that it
doesn’t specifically affect this budget due to it sitting as an overhead.
Cr Tennent  sought clarification about whether funds could only
be taken from 3 water targeted rate.  Officers confirmed this to be the
case.
Mayor Walker asked what the disadvantages were for option 2 around
affordability for ratepayers.
Officers noted that it would be likely that Council needed to make a
similar decision around funding three waters in 12 months’ time.
Cr Sharp moved option 2 from the report - that the activity was loan
funded to lessen impact to ratepayers.  He acknowledged that this was only
a stop gap measure however that when imposing the new regulations, Central government
have inferred that funding may be available later.
Cr Tennent raised the need to loan fund despite this being an
operational matter, because the rating consequences would be too much in one
year otherwise.  Seeing rates increases higher than initially
indicated.  Opportunity to rationalise some other expenditure for next
year.
Cr Aitken noted his frustration that Council need to borrow money
for regulatory expense.
Challenge for a small community to be able to afford this
compliance.  Cr Aitken supported the motion with reluctance but felt the
risk was too high not to.
Cr Muggeridge agreed that loan funding was the only viable option.
Mayor Walker highlighted the risk in loan funding over a long period
of time, given likely increased costs in subsequent years.  Mayor Walker
also highlighted the need to take compliance seriously and so expressed reluctant
support for the motion.
Cr Sharp reiterated how unfortunate it is that territorial
authorities must reap these costs.
6.2         Central
Hawke's Bay District Community Trust - Request for additional funding
PURPOSE
The purpose of this report is to present further
information to Council to determine whether to provide additional annual
funding for operational costs to the CHB Community Trust.
Resolved:  19.43
Moved:       Cr Shelley
Burne-Field
Seconded:  Cr Ian
Sharp
That having considered all
matters raised in the report:
a)         That
Council provide additional funding to the Central Hawke's Bay District
Community Trust of $14,500 ongoing, above and beyond the current
Service Agreement value, noting an additional rating impact of $8,910 in the
2019/20 year; or
Carried
Mayor Walker sought clarification on what other funding is available
for trusts in this situation.
Officers confirmed that they were limited in terms of external
funding and that sponsorship is the only avenue that the trust could explore.
Cr Tennent sought clarification about whether there was an ability
for the trust to approach the operator of the pool to source extra funding.
Officers confirmed that this could be a long term option but it
would rely on renegotiation of contract with operator.
Cr Sharp commended the trust for their foresight in highlighting
this need at the time of the annual plan, rather than waiting for annual June
reporting.
Cr Minehan asked whether the trust could access any invested
reserves for increased insurance costs.  Officers confirmed that there was
no money available to access as it was renewal money for governance of the
facility.
Councillor Burne-Field asked for clairifcation of the ongoing
sustainability of the trust’s capacity to get more external funding to
cover future costs.
Officers confirmed that this had been discussed with the trust and
that the initial insurance increase was higher than anticipated.  There
was relative confidence that the future costs would be able to be managed in
future.
Cr Burne-Field moved option one from the officer’s report.
Cr Sharp highlighted that the cost of running the facility is
substantial however if it were a Council operated facility the cost would be
higher. Cr Sharp commended the trust for seeking best deal for insurance.
Cr Annand raised that further information had been needed to ensure
that we were supporting trust to be successful and is in support of the motion.
Cr Tennent highlighted that the pool is a great community facility
but had concerns with the budget allocation process which made it difficult to
foresee what rates rises would be when doing Long Term Planning.
Cr Burne-Field declared an indirect conflict with her sister in law
being a trustee of the trust.
Cr Aitken raised his frustration that other options could be
explored if more time was given.
Meeting suspended at 4.05pm
Meeting reconvened at 4.08pm
Cr Annand returned to meeting at 4.09pm
