Recommendation
That the Māori Committee accepts the
following “Minor items not on the Agenda” for
discussion as Item 14:
Item
Topic
Raised by
1.
Article re Shingle extraction
application – Request further update herein.
Marei Apatu
The Chair gave an
opportunity to Matahiwi tangata whenua members to raise any items of interest
to the Committee and introduced Tom Mulligan.  Discussions traversed:
·
Tom Mulligan, Matahiwi kaumatua advised that
works will be done at the wharenui under the tutorship of Jacob Scott. The Māori carvings and maihi will be
replaced where required and the tukutuku panels will be repaired.
·
Concerns were raised around the condition of the
Clive and Karamu rivers, especially around the silt and flow of the rivers and
referred to the HBRC’s plan in the upgrading of the rivers. Suggested that
floodgates be put in to decrease flow.
·
Council is eager to get the rivers back into
their original state, but need to maintain their drainage tasks.
·
Riparian planting programme will assist with shading
for ecological purposes.
·
The rivers are spring fed and due to heavy
irrigation, the groundwater use during summer causes for the springs to often run
dry.
·
The TANK Plan Change will limit any further water
takes. The allocation of water for taking at times of high flow for storage and
use for activities, was recommended by TANK as a concept for further
consideration and development by the RPC.
·
Another challenge experienced is the silt and
sediment that builds up in the Clive river – dredging programme planned
for 2018 to enhance the flow of the river.
·
Looking into options in diverting some portions
of the Ngaruroro river back into the Karamu system for flushing.  Might be
part of a bigger augmentation storage program that uses stormwater.
·
Workshops are to be held this year to find a
long term solutions.

Verbal Presentation by Department
Internal Affairs on a new Funding Programme, Oranga Marae
The Chair, Mike Mohi introduced Norman
Apirana and Wayne Ormsby of the Department of Internal Affairs Te Tari
Taiwhenua who delivered a presentation an overview of their joint working
programme to provide resources to marae across the rohe.  Discussions
traversed:
·
Purpose of the program is to support the
physical and cultural revitalisation of marae as centres of Māori identity and mātauranga.
·
In the past the Department Internal Affairs
had a program called Marae Heritage and the programme specifically focussed
on facility itself.
·
The fund used to be called the Marae Heritage Fund
and in in May 2017 budget, the Government contributed money for the
revitalisation of marae.  During Aug 2017 Te Puni Kōkiri and Government formed a new fund called the Oranga Marae Fund.
·
The revitalization was the key difference from
the previous Marae Heritage Fund.
·
Main things to be funded now includes tikanga,
cultural items that marae may require.
·
The eligibility must be for a traditional or
urban marae, which has to be on a marae reservation land or General Land and
gazetted for the purposes of a marae, and be submitted by a governing body
with legal entity status or be a Māori reservation, as well as have active and appropriate governance
and management controls and appropriate financial systems and policies in
place.
·
Three stages of Oranga marae which includes
1). Marae plan development, 2). Technical reports and 3). Implementation.
·
A marae development plan needs to be developed
to access any funding.  The plan must include things like Vision,
Cultural aspirations, Physical aspirations, Assessment of current state and
opportunities, Action Plan and must be endorsed by the wider whanau and
Trustees.
·
A technical and feasibility reports may be
necessary to support capital works projects like resource/building consents,
architectural design plans, feasibility report, geotechnical report and
condition report.
·
Oranga marae funding can assist to implement
physical and cultural aspirations as identified in the marae development
plan.
·
No longer require a 1/3 monetary contribution
towards the application.
·
Contact Te Puni Kōkiri or Department of Internal Affairs
Staff (or both) to access Oranga Marae Funding: at www.tpk.govt.nz/en/whakamahia/oranga-marae or www.communitymatters.govt.nz/oranga-marae
·
A one on one presentation to individual
marae’s will be given should there be a need for explaining the funding
options available.
MC3/19
Resolution
That the Māori
Committee receives the “Verbal
Presentation by the Department Internal Affairs on new funding programme -
Oranga Marae”.

Council wants to collaborate with tāngata whenua.
James Palmer added:
·
HBRC catchment staff currently engage with
landowners to discuss plans and issues on the property and where to plant.
·
Currently various planting programmes running including
Erosion Control Grants Scheme and Hill Country Erosion Fund. Council has applied
for “One billion trees” funding and will leverage its own
resources alongside that funding. An update on the tree planting projects and
the Erosion Control Scheme will be given at the next Māori Committee meeting.

the TANK Plan change with designated iwi authorities, local authorities and
local Government and it is anticipated full public notification will be made by

·
In response to a query about whether
businesses will be prosecuted for polluting the Ahuriri estuary, James

discharges into the estuary as a result of spills. HBRC is working alongside
Napier City Council to lift the level of performance for the industrial sites
in terms of treatment and collection of stormwater on site including looking
into relocating of some of the high risk activities.
·
Plans to develop Lagoon farm into a wetlands
system for stormwater runoff. Some trials have been done, but it is a very
complex system.
·
Hastings District Council also looking into a
wetlands system between Hastings and Napier for stormwater discharges.
·
