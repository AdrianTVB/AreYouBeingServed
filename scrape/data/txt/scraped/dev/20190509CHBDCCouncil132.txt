PURPOSE
In accordance with Standing Order 26, the Chief Executive
has received a Notice of Motion from Councillor Burne-Field, seconded by
Councillor Minehan, with the request that the Notice of Motion be placed on
the agenda for the 9 May 2019 Council meeting.

for Council to consider appropriate courses of action.
Resolved:
19.23
Moved:       Cr Shelley
Burne-Field
Seconded:  Cr
Gerard Minehan
That having considered all
matters raised in the report:
a)         That
Council requests that the Chief Executive prepare a report to be considered
as part of Annual Plan deliberations on the 23 May 2019 on the funding and
finance options to prioritise the implementation of the Dust Suppression
Policy;
b)         And
further that the report include options and recommendations on allocation
from the Rural Reserve Fund, reprioritisation of existing transport
investment, and options for investment via the general rate.
Carried
Cr Burne-Field spoke to the Notice of Motion.
Cr Minehan spoke in support of the motion and about the dissatisfaction
in the district about the condition of rural roads.  Cr Minehan highlighted
that through the Project Thrive process, the community was clear that they
wanted Council to bring a new approach to dust suppression issues.
Mayor Walker agreed that getting more information from staff was a
good idea but did have some reservations about how much funding could be
allocated to dust suppression at this moment in time.
Mayor Walker indicated that this would likely need to inform the
next Long Term Plan discussion.
