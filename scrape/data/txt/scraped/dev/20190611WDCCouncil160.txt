RESOLUTION  2019/27  

Moved:

Cr Jeremy Harker 

11 JUNE 2019 

CARRIED 

Council  notes  while  there  are  changes  in  the  following  areas;  capital  subsidies,  other  operating 
expenses, asset purchases and construction and the use of reserves but as these changes did not 
impact  Council’s  financial  strategy  or  the  limits  set  under  the  financial  prudent  regulations  and 
confirms the need not to consult. 

That Council adopts the Annual Plan 2019/20 attached as Appendix 1, noting that Council did not 
need to consult as stated in Section 95 (2A) Local Government Act as it is of the opinion there are 
no  significant  or  material  differences  between  Year  2  of  Council’s  LTP  and  2019/20  Annual  Plan, 
with the following amendments: 

1)  In  the  legend  on  Operating  Costs  Vs.  Expenditure  section  (p.  7),  change  the  label 
“Reserves/Capital Subsidy” to “Reserves”. Also, on the graph, change the Capex Transport 
Subsidies  &  Grants  amount  from  $10,029  to  $10,853,  and  change  the  Capex  Transport 
Reserves amount from $2,312 to $1,488.  

2)  Under  the  Basis  for  Liability  column  (p.  42)  of  the  Targeted  Rate  –  Drainage  table  in  the 
Rates FIS, change the text “Per separately used or inhabited part of a rating unit” to “Per 
rateable part of a rating unit”.  

3)  To the Significant Initiatives section (p. 16), add in a section on THREE WATERS, and to this 

add the following text: 
“The  New  Zealand  Government  is  currently  reviewing  how  the  three  waters  (drinking 
water,  wastewater  and  stormwater)  are  managed.    In  a  Cabinet  paper  released  on  20 
November  2018,  the  Government  indicated  that,  alongside  regulatory  changes,  there  is 
likely  to  be  major  structural  reform  of  the  local  government  water  sector.  The  Cabinet 
paper  described  a  system  facing  significant  issues,  saying  “the  scale  of  the  challenge 
indicates  that  the  status  quo  is  not  sustainable  in  the  long term”.   Among  the  key  issues 
identified  were  weak  regulation,  capability  challenges  (particularly  for  smaller  councils), 
funding  and  financing  issues  for  upgrading  infrastructure,  in  relation  to  which  the 
Government  stated  “for  many  smaller  councils,  there  is  no  clear  way  forward  given  the 
scale of the challenges”.  
Through  the  Government’s  consultation  process  it  has  encouraged  stakeholders  to  put 
forward  their  best  suggestions  as  to  what  reform  may  look  like.    The  three  options  for 
reform  are  now  expected  to  be  considered  progressively  with  the  first  announcements 
relating to the regulatory reform package expected in June 2019.  The five councils within 
the  Hawke’s  Bay  Region  including  Central  Hawke’s  Bay  District  Council,  Hastings  District 
Council, Hawke’s Bay Regional Council, Napier City Council and Wairoa District Council (the 
Councils)  have  collectively  commenced  a  review  of  Hawke’s  Bay’s  three  waters  service 
delivery.    The  primary  objective  of  this  review  is  to  complete  an  assessment  and 

Page 6 

ORDINARY COUNCIL MEETING MINUTES 

11 JUNE 2019 

recommendations of the current and potential service delivery models for three waters in 
the  Hawke’s  Bay  region.    The  review’s  first  phase  is  progressing  well  and  is  intended  to 
provide  the  Councils  with  information  to  engage  with  central  government  on  the  water 
sector reforms.  Ultimately a recommendation will be provided to the Councils about the 
best way forward.  It will then be for the Councils and their communities to decide the next 
steps.”  

4)  On page 46, change name listed from “Sharon Cooper/Stone” to “Sharon Cooper-Stone”.
