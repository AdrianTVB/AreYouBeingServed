Speed Bylaw Review
(Document 19/)
Her Worship the Mayor outlined the
process to be followed in relation to the hearing of those submitters who had
indicated a wish to appear in support of their submissions.
Additional speed limit requests made
would be included in the next Speed Bylaw review.  It was proposed that
a Statement of Proposal for these would be presented to Council in February
2020 for adoption to consult, with hearing of submissions taking place in May
2020.
The Council then proceeded to hear the
submitters.
PRESENTATION OF VERBAL SUBMISSIONS
Submission No. 345 - George MacMillan spoke to his submission in regard to Proposal 6  to adopt a
50km/hr speed limit, which he did not support.  Kereru Road was an
integral road through Maraekakaho into Hastings.  Future subdivisions on
Kereru Road would substantially effect the roading network.  The existing
stretch of 50km/hr area encompassed the school and high density area.
Mr MacMillan said that the area was no different to rural subdivision
throughout the Hastings district and should not be treated differently.
Councillor Poulain joined the meeting
at 9.06am
Mr MacMillan displayed two maps (CG-14-1-01473)
and contested that Maraekakaho was not a high density area. Mr MacMillan felt
that if the speed limit was reduced it would set a precedent for all rural
roads to have lower speed zones.
Councillor Barber joined the meeting at
9.11am
Mr MacMillan referred to the summary of
submissions and some of the reasons given in support of the proposal for
reducing the speed limit and commented that it was not a safety issue as
there had been zero crashes in proposed stretch of road.
Rural
roads were being grouped in with urban areas and using the reason of safety
with no substantial evidence and do not use common sense.
The meeting noted that Mr MacMillan
travelled through the area but did not live there.
Submission No. 350 - Christine Cheyne spoke to the submission on behalf of
Cycle Aware Hawke’s Bay.  Cycle Aware Hawke’s Bay supported
all of the speed change proposals.  If Hastings District Council wished
to increase the rate of active transport and reduce carbon emissions from
single occupant vehicles, it was important to reduce vehicle speeds. As well
a safer road environment supported cycle tourism which had economic benefits
for the district and region.
While Proposal 4 was supported Ms Cheyne
considered that the extension of the 50 km/h limit to Gilpin Road did not go
far enough and needed to extend to School Road.
There were changing trends in transport
and mobility and trips in vehicles increasing congestion.  Supported
lower speed limits with increased commuting and recreational cycling.
Ms Cheyne supported reducing speed limits
in other districts and opposed any implementation of 100km/hr into 50km/hr
areas such as Clive heading towards Napier.  Reducing from 100km/hr to
80km/hr prior to 50km/hr area.
The meeting felt that it would be
helpful in the future:
·      To have data relating to other modes of transports other than just
vehicles.
·      Information of whether submitter lives in the area.
·      Weighting attributed to relevant parties.
·      Clarity in statistics in favour or against proposal.
·      Whether a road user.
The meeting discussed Bellarby Lane as
a possible compromise to have the speed limit from 50km/hr from Bellerby
Lane.
Submission No. 366 – Colin Goble
spoke on behalf of the Automobile Association in
support of Proposals 1,2,3,5 and 6.  Mr Goble did not support Proposal 4
to reduce the speed to 50km/hr on Te Aute Road.  The proposed Ryman
development was only going to have one entrance way for all users midway
along the straight.
Mr Goble recommeded an 80kph speed limit and it be
extended around the Gilpin Road Intersection curve.  A
separate entrance way at north eastern corner of the Ryman development be put
in for vulnerable road user (Pedestrians/Cyclist/Mobility Scooters) so that
main entrance is only for vehicles.
Mr Goble said it was important when speed
limits were lowered to have some engineering measures to ensure speed limit would
reduce. Speed limit alone could not address the issues and said it was the
engineering measures that were far more effective that speed reduction.
Roads needed to be not only safe but
efficient.  Getting safety level and retaining efficiency of that road.
Speed limits applied but lowered.  Should be seeing more effort in
engineering work to retain speed limit higher to improve roads efficiency and
safety.  The economy of the region needed to be consider as well as
safety.
Mr Goble suggested that relocation of the
concrete lamppost at the accessway to the Church to address visibility
concerns.
Mr Goble advised that the AA supported
the 80km/hr for Te Ara Kakahikatea, however 90km/hr might be more appropriate
which was in line with speed limits for heavy commercial vehicles.
Submission No. 329 - Jeremy Moore spoke on behalf of Ryman Healthcare in support of the proposed
speed limit change from 100km/hr to 50km/hr along Te Aute Road (Proposal
4).  Te Aute Road has a medium of high collective risk and a high
personal risk.  Creating a safer and more appropriate speed limit in the
area proposed would reduce these risks to retirement village residents as
well as the wider community, including users of the Village Baptist Church.
Speed limit change was fundamental to
construction of the new development.  Ryman had Invested in the site
based on a level of comfort from discussions with Council. The village was
urgently needed and would make a significant positive contribution to
district.  Mr Moore stated that the approval of the speed reduction to
50km/hr was pivotal for the development proceeding.  The development
would not proceed if the speed limit of 100km/hr remained in place.
Assuming the speed limit was approved the
development would provide 147 townhouses, 78 assisted living and 90 care beds
for the district.
During construction would be the generation
of $120-$140m to the economy and up to 200 local people employed.  Approximately
160 operational jobs would be created.  There was the added benefit that
Village people sell their old family homes which helped to relieve the housing
market.
There would be only one entranceway to
the Ryman Developments located centrally as they did not want traffic
travelling all through the Village and could go either way at the centre.
Mr Moore confirmed that he was happy with
the 50km/hr area at the beginning of the development site, where traffic
calming measures would also be included, to extend further past the Church
and around the corner that leads into Te Aute Road.
The Group Manager: Asset Management, Mr
Thew, advised that the six proposals had been brought forward due to the development related speed limit changes from the wider speed
limit review. The wider speed limit review, which consisted of public
requests, NZTA high priority sites, CBD review and consistency with
neighbouring councils, was scheduled to progress in February 2020.  In
that list of items for full consultation Te Aute Road would be considered in
its entirety.
_______________________
The meeting adjourned for morning tea at 10.35am
and reconvened at 10.50am
_______________________
Submission No. 260 - Herbert Leijen had submitted an apology but had
emailed (CG-14-1-01465) two major issues which was circulated at the
meeting.  The issues related to emission control and keeping the roads
well maintained and open for efficiency and transport costs low.
Mr Leijen did not support any of the
proposals and for Te Aute Road he requested a parallel road, futureproof the
new subdivisions by maintaining arterials into the centre of town.
Submission No. 294 - Alastair Chalmers had submitted an apology and the meeting referred to
his written submission.  Mr Chalmers did not support any of the
proposals and considered that lowering speed limits was counter-productive as
slower speeds meant people did not pay as much attention and were easily
distracted.  Driver education was required.
This concluded the hearing of submissions
where submitters had chosen to speak to Council.
The Acting Transportation Engineer, Mr O’Connor providing a brief overview on the process and background of
setting speed limits on local roads.  On 2 May 2019, Council accepted
the recommendation to adopt the proposed speed limit changes and Statement of
Proposal to go out to public consultation.
A total of 363 formal submissions were received in relation to the
Proposed Amendments to the Council’s Speed Limits Bylaw 2012. The
proposed amendments relate to the following six separate proposals for speed
limit changes throughout the district.
·
Proposal 1 – Irongate Road East
·
Proposal 2 – Maraekakaho Road
·
Proposal 3 – East Road
·
Proposal 4 – Te Aute Road
·
Proposal 5 – Te Ara Kahikatea
·
Proposal 6 – Kereru Road
Mr O’Connor advised that for a
speed limit of 70km/h and 90km/h approval was required from NZTA and it was
rarely approved as they were trying to phase out those speed limits.
NZTA preference was for 60km/h and 80km/h as interim speed limits.
The meeting then considered the Six Proposals.
PROPOSAL 6:
KERERU ROAD
The speed limit change proposal on Kereru
Road was to extend the 50km/hr speed limit zone from
the existing 50/100 km/hr signs to a point approximately 580m west of the intersection
with Bellerby Lane.
This was to account for the recent development on Bellerby Lane
and the upcoming residential development and expansion of the Maraekakaho
settlement along Kereru Road.
There were 249 responses for Kereru Road with 100 in
favour of the proposed change.
It was noted that in the Maraekakaho Community Plan
road safety and future proofing roading to allow for future community
expansion was one of their objectives.
General Counsel, Mr Smith, advised that the Local
Government Act imposed obligations on how to make a bylaw.  Consultation
was required and a Statement of Proposal issued.  Departure from the
Statement of Proposal that had been consulted on raises the issue that
someone who may have wanted to make a submission has been denied the
opportunity.
The Engineer’s report has signalled possible
options for the future and options through this process.  Future options
could feed into wider review in the future.
PROPOSAL 6: KERERU ROAD
In Principle
The Meeting Agreed
That
Council adopt the 50km/hr speed limit zone be extended from the existing
50/100 km/hr signs to a point approximately 100m west of the intersection
with Bellerby Lane.
PROPOSAL 1: IRONGATE ROAD EAST
The speed limit change proposal on Irongate
Road East was to reduce the 100km/h speed limit to 50km/h from the
intersection of Maraekakaho Road to the end of the cul-de-sac.
This was due to the recent re-zoning of
the land to industrial, and the increased traffic movements associated with level
of industrial development that has taken place.
PROPOSAL 1: IRONGATE ROAD EAST
In Principle
The Meeting Agreed
That Council adopt 50km/hr for
Irongate Road East, as per the Draft Statement of Proposal (LEG-02-34-19-534).
PROPOSAL 2: MARAEKAKAHO ROAD
The speed limit change proposal on Maraekakaho Road was to reduce
the speed limit from 100km/hr to 80km/hr from the existing 70/100 km/hr signs
to a point approximately 150m north of the intersection with State Highway
50A, a total length of approximately 2km.
It should be noted that on 1 August
1 2019, NZTA re-numbered State Highway 50A to State Highway 2.  Any
updates to the bylaw would reflect this change.
PROPOSAL 2: MARAEKAKAHO ROAD
In Principle
The Meeting Agreed
That Council
adopt that the speed limit be reduced from 100km/hr
to 80km/hr from the existing 70/100 km/hr signs to a point approximately 150m
north of the intersection with State Highway 50A as per the Draft Statement of
Proposal (LEG-02-34-19-534).
.
PROPOSAL 3:
EAST ROAD
The speed limit change proposal on East Road was to extend the
50km/hr speed limit zone from the existing 50/100 km/hr signs to a point
approximately 260m west of the intersection with Rockwood Place.
This is to account
for the expansion of the urban area due to recent residential development.
Mr O’Connor
advised that a future option review was further extension of the urban
50km/hr zone as part of future speed limit review.
PROPOSAL 3:
EAST ROAD
In Principle
The Meeting Agreed
That Council
adopt a 50km/hr speed limit zone extension from the existing 50/100 km/hr
signs to a point approximately 260m west of the intersection with Rockwood
Place as per the Draft
Statement of Proposal (LEG-02-34-19-534)
Councillor Heaps did not support
Proposal 3
PROPOSAL 4:
TE AUTE ROAD
The speed limit change proposal on Te
Aute Road was to extend the 50km/hr speed limit zone from
the existing 50/100 km/hr signs to a point approximately 230m north of the
intersection with Gilpin Road, a total extension of 500m.
This is to account for the increased
traffic and pedestrian movements associated with the proposed retirement
village on the western side and the Village Baptist Church on the eastern
side.
Mr
O’Connor advised that the proposal brought forward to consider was only
for development associated changes.  Potentially recommendations from crash
reduction studies would include future speed limit review.  Officers
would work with the Church on improvements in regard to safety issues at
their entranceway.
Review the
remainder of Te Aute Road, including further extension of the urban 50km/hr
zone as part of future speed limit review.
The Group
Manager: Asset Management, Mr Thew, advised that the Te Aute/Middle Roads in
terms of future development in the Heretaunga Plans Urban Design Strategy (HPUDS)
did impact on this particular area.  The area to the east of Te Aute
Road was forecast for residential and it was in the reserve part of the
Strategy and could potentially become residential in the future.
