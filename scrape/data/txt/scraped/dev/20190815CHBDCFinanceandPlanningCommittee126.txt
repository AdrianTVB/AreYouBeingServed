Against:           Crs
Tim Chote, Gerard Minehan and Brent Muggeridge
carried 5/3
Carried
Cr Aitken highlighted the concern that at $6000 per annum per child,
that a member with multiple children would incur high costs.
Officers confirmed that the committee could decide to cap the
amounts per member and include in future policy.
Cr Tennent considered that although it was a positive step forward
to encourage people to stand for Council, that it was not in the budget.
He then sought clarification on the financial impact it would have in 2020.
Mrs Davidson determined that it would be included in future budgets as part of
the draft annual plan 2020/21
Cr Sharp sought clarification on whether by the current Council
accepting the policy, that it would create a cost that couldn’t not be
avoided by the new Council.
Officers confirmed that the newly elected Council did not have to
adopt the new policy if they did not wish to.
Cr Tennent asked why a committee in this term was voting on a future
council matter.
Mrs Davidson confirmed that an example had been taken from other
councils and that it could provide some certainly to incoming candidates about
whether the childcare allowance would be available or not.
Mayor Walker spoke to the motion that the allowance was important to
local government given that  females and all people under 40 are underrepresented
and that cost of childcare is a barrier.   She spoke in support of the
policy because it was important to be clear to the community and new councils
that the table supports mixed representation.
Cr Chote spoke against the motion asking what allowances there are
for other groups of people.
He raised that the new Council should make the decision and that the
policy needs to cover a wider group.
Cr Aitken agreed with both Mayor Walker and Cr Chote.
He would be in favour of capping the amount per elected member.
Cr Minehan spoke against the motion because the determination was
light on details and he was concerned about the precedent it could set.
Cr Sharp stated that there were barriers for a number of people to
stand for Council but that this would be a simple way of dealing with some of
the issues around low remuneration for the work of Councillors.
Mayor Walker highlighted that while there was a perception around
fairness of the allowance for groups such as business owners, that there is a particular
barrier for people who struggle to be representative at this level due to
issues with childcare.
She raised that the remuneration authority had considered this at a
national level and determined that there was a need.

Carried

upgrade and the issue with the colouration in the water and whether that had
changed anything in the project.
Officers confirmed that it has not changed the timeframe of the
project but that the issue did highlight there was a need for contingency and a
plan is in place for a flushing programme.
Cr Muggeridge asked about the Otane Wastewater line going through
White Road and whether contractors would seal holes where the alternate water
supply runs or leave them open.
Mr de Klerk confirmed that separate trenches would be run.
Cr Minehan asked about progress on the  Waipukurau 2nd
supply and whether we had located other areas to drill in.  Officers
confirmed that 5 locations had been shortlisted based on a set of criteria and
that they were continuing to work through options.
5.5         Key

update of the District Plan Review.
Committee Resolution
Moved:       Cr David
Tennent
Seconded:  Cr
Tim Aitken
That, having considered all matters raised in the
report, the report be noted.
Carried
Cr Tennent asked that Mrs O’Shaughnessy give an explanation of
what the implications of the national planning standards would be for the
district plan.
It was confirmed that the intention is for plans throughout the country
to be consistent in structure but that it did not have an impact on the provisions
in the district plan.  It is possible that there may be a need to change
some definitions and the layout.
Cr Sharp asked whether the national planning standards would have an
effect on budget.
Officers confirmed that the Ministry for the Environment  would
be undertaking this work at their own cost so had no impact on council
budgets.  Cr Sharp commended Mrs O’Shaughnessy on her relationship
with the ministry.
Cr Annand asked whether subcommittee members could provide some
insight about the intention for hearings.  Cr Sharp suggested that the subcommittee
be maintained for those hearings as they have a good understanding of the
content of the plan.
Cr Minehan asked whether all Councillors would get a full set of
submissions to the draft district plan.  It was confirmed that they would.
