(Note:
While the above evidence had been pre-circulated electronically prior to the
hearing, for ease of reference some hard copies of the written evidence had

Additional
evidence was tabled and circulated at the hearing, as detailed in these
minutes.
A series of visuals of the area in question in the form of
five power point slides (97017#0271), as forwarded by
the Applicant, were made available to be displayed and addressed at appropriate
times during the hearing by any parties as required.
At the
hearing:
Kaumātua, Jerry Hapuku, gave an
opening address to the hearing and gave the karakia (prayer).
A reply to the opening address was given by Commissioner Rauru
Kirikiri on behalf of the commissioners.  This was followed by a waiata.
Commissioner
Paul Cooney (Chair) and Commissioner Rauru Kirikiri introduced themselves.
The Chair outlined the process to be followed at the hearing.
Cross-examination was not permitted but the parties to the hearing could ask
points of clarification of a witness or submitter, through the Chair.
The
commissioners had undertaken a site visit the previous day (10 June)
accompanied by a graduate planner, Tom Hosford, who had no connection to the
application.
The
commissioners advised that they had accepted the late submission by Mike
Devonshire (Te Mata Park Trust Board).
That
pursuant to section 37 of the Resource Management Act 1991, the Hearings Commissioners
resolve to extend the timeframe for lodging submissions in relation to the application
for the Craggy Range Track Remediation work from the closing date of 15 March
2019 to 20 March 2019, to enable the late submission from Mr Mike Devonshire (Te
Mata Park Trust Board) to be accepted.
The commissioners further advised that they had read all
the submissions and the pre-circulated evidence prior to the hearing.
Therefore, the Chair asked the expert witnesses to summarise and highlight the
key points they wanted to address in their respective evidence.  However,
the other submitters addressing the hearing may read out their submissions in
full when presenting their evidence, if they wished to do so.
Members of
the press present were reminded that filming and audio
recording for broadcast of the hearing will be restricted to the opening and
the applicant’s presentation.  Any media interviews will be up to
the individuals involved and will be conducted outside of the hearings process
and venue.
Evidence
on behalf of the Applicant - Hastings
District Council (“HDC”):
Dr James
Graham, Pou Ahurea Matua – Principal
Advisor: Relationships, Responsiveness and Heritage, Hastings District Council
gave an apology on behalf of the Council,
acknowledging the incorrect processing of the resource consent which had allowed
the track to be developed.  He circulated a written copy of the comments
that he had made (97017#0260).
The
commissioners acknowledged the apology made on behalf of the council and
clarified with the applicant that the latter was saying from a negative
situation, hopefully a positive outcome could be achieved between the council
and local tangata whenua.
Laura Bielby
– Legal Counsel introduced the other expert witnesses who would be addressing the
hearing on behalf of the applicant.  She noted
that evidence from each of these expert witnesses had been pre-circulated to
the parties prior to the hearing as required, as listed below.  Each of
the expert witnesses would in turn address their respective evidence or circulate
and present a subsequent summary statement of that evidence when they addressed
the hearing.
Laura Bielby circulated and read her Opening Legal Submissions (97017#0248), on
behalf of the applicant and responded to questions from the commissioners.
The
commissioners also sought clarification of the following points:
·
how
most of the work had been undertaken before any other party noticed.
·
as
to whether the hearing documentation had stated that the track had originally
been intended as a cycling track, as well as a walking track.
·
about
the retrospective consent granted on 7 June 2019 and requested a copy of the
associated conditions.
·
that
the BioCoir matting was proposed only in Area “C” (shown in red on
the displayed power point visuals (97017#0271)) – not in Area
“B”.
·
the
applicant’s position that the proposed remediation work would be a restricted
discretionary activity, while the reporting planner stated it was a discretionary
activity.
·
that
there had been a further omission in the resource consent process – with
an archaeological authority being needed from Heritage New Zealand Pouhere
Taonga before any remedial work can be undertaken.
During the
presentation of the applicant’s evidence, drone footage from two videos
of the track were shown (97017#0285 and 97017#0284) – with the first
video showing the newly placed BioCoir matting (in 2018) and the second video
taken several months later (6/6/19).  Four still photos from the video
footage on 6/6/19 were also shown (97017#0287 to 97017#0290 inclusive).
__________________
The hearing adjourned for morning tea at 10.25am
and resumed at 10.48am.
__________________
At this point,
copies of the retrospective consent (RMA20180531) granted
on 7 June 2019 were given to the commissioners (97017#0198; 97017#0122; and
97017#0045).
The
commissioners were also given information on the decision (RMA20170324) regarding
the earthworks for the track (97017#0012) - including the fact that the
track was to be clearly signposted at both ends as being restricted to
pedestrians only (no bikes).
As noted at the
start of these minutes, the pre-circulated evidence from the applicant’s expert
witnesses had been combined into a document (CG-14-21-00381)
and put onto the council website.  The
following list details the original evidence from each witness and any subsequent
summary statements of evidence presented at the hearing:
·
Trevor
Butler – Principal Engineering Consultant at Frame Group Ltd - addressing
technical issues – initial pre-circulated evidence (97017#0141) and
summary statement of evidence (97017#0259).
·
Rebecca
Ryder – Landscape Architect at Boffa Miskell Ltd - initial pre-circulated

·

Kydd-Smith – Principal Planner at Sage Planning HB Limited - initial pre-circulated
evidence (97017#0143).
Trevor
Butler addressed his summary
statement of evidence (97017#0259) on behalf
of the applicant and
responded to extensive questions from the commissioners - clarifying the
gradient involved and how the proposed works would be undertaken.
Through the
Chair, at this point Rob Enright, Legal Counsel for Waimārama
Māori Committee and Waimārama Marae and appearing for the
Environmental Defence Society Inc, sought a point of
clarification from Trevor Butler regarding the vertical distance from the
bottom to the top point of the proposed fill.
Rebecca
Ryder circulated and
addressed her summary statement of evidence (97017#0250)
on behalf of the applicant.  She
showed the earlier noted drone footage in the form of two videos and four still
photos from the video footage and responded to questions from the commissioners.
Gaylynne
Carter addressed her summary statement of evidence (97017#0255) and accompanying
site record form and associated information (97017#0254) on behalf of the applicant.  She responded to extensive questions
from the commissioners - outlining the procedure and time frame involved in
applying for an archaeological authority from Heritage New Zealand Pouhere
Taonga and explaining the point at which iwi became involved in this process.
Janeen
Kydd-Smith
addressed and summarised her initial pre-circulated evidence (97017#0143) on
behalf of the applicant, but did not present a summary statement of evidence.
She confirmed that the applicant’s view that the proposed remediation
work would be a restricted discretionary activity; and that the BioCoir matting
was only proposed in Area “C”.  The commissioners did not ask
any questions of Mrs Kydd-Smith at this point in the hearing.
This concluded
the presentation of the evidence on behalf of the applicant.

Presentation
of evidence by Submitters:
Warwick
Marshall circulated and read his statement of
evidence (97017#0262) and responded to questions from the commissioners.
Stuart Perry
addressed his statement of evidence (97017#0261)
and responded to questions from the commissioners.
Xan Harding addressed the hearing on behalf of the Te Mata Peak
Peoples’ Track Society Inc (‘the Society”).  He had
previously forwarded two letters (dated 30/10/18 and 13/2/19) containing legal
opinions prepared for the Society (97017#0144 and 97017#0145) which had
been pre-circulated as expert submitter evidence.  At the hearing he
displayed and addressed a power point presentation (97017#0283).  He
responded to questions from the commissioners.
The
commissioners noted that they had earlier asked the legal counsel for the
applicant, Laura Bielby, to comment on the two legal opinion letters presented
by the Society - in respect of whether those letters appeared to have taken a “back
to front” approach in addressing the issues involved - as they did not
believe it was fair to ask Mr Harding to comment on those legal aspects.
The hearing adjourned at 2.15pm

Evidence
on behalf of the Applicant - Hastings
District Council (“HDC”):
Dr James
Graham, Pou Ahurea Matua – Principal
Advisor: Relationships, Responsiveness and Heritage, Hastings District Council
gave an apology on behalf of the Council, repeating
the comments he had made on the first day of the hearing acknowledging the
incorrect processing of the resource consent which had allowed the track to be
developed.  He circulated a written copy of the comments that he had made (97017#0260).
Continuation
of the presentation of evidence by Submitters:
Rob Enright, Legal Counsel for Waimārama Māori Committee
and Waimārama Marae and also appearing for the Environmental Defence
Society Inc made some opening comments.  He
introduced Robert MacDonald and also expert witness Diane Lucas.
Robert MacDonald addressed the hearing, on
behalf of the Trustees of Waimārama Māori Committee and
Waimārama Marae, and read his detailed affidavit that had been
prepared for the High Court (97017#0351).  He responded to
questions from the commissioners - emphasising that if the application had been
notified Waimārama would have lodged an objection.  He accepted the
apology from the Council.
In response to further questions from the commissioners, Mr
MacDonald explained that it wasn’t until the track was almost completed
they could appreciate the scale and nature of the works.  They then attended
scheduled Māori Committee meetings and followed certain steps in that
process before being mandated by Waimārama to address this issue on their
behalf, which had taken a number of weeks.
Rob Enright, Legal Counsel for Waimārama Māori Committee
and Waimārama Marae and also appearing for the Environmental Defence
Society Inc circulated and read his Legal
Submissions (97017#0352).  He also circulated a copy of an Environment
Court Decision - Western Bay of Plenty District Council v Bay of Plenty
Regional Council [2017] NZEnvC 147 - (97017#0357).
Mr Enright responded to questions from the commissioners, noting the
importance of involving mana whenua and hapu groups; suggesting a plan change
to protect the cultural landscape; and noting the ongoing duty of Council to
monitor this aspect.  He also asked the commissioners to consider
including some observations in their decision regarding inadequacies in the
District Plan relating to the protection of the Peak, given its cultural
significance.
The commissioners noted that some of the points made by Mr Enright
had also been raised the previous day by the Te Mata Peak Peoples’
Track Society Inc (the “Society”).
Mr Enright was asked to comment on the two
legal opinion letters (97017#0144 and 97017#0145) presented as expert submitter evidence by the Society - in respect of whether those
letters appeared to have taken a “back to front” approach in
addressing the issues involved.  The commissioners had also asked this
question of the applicant’s legal counsel earlier in the hearing.
Landscape Architect, Diane Lucas,
addressed the hearing on behalf of Waimārama Māori Committee of
Waimārama Marae.  She spoke to her pre-circulated expert written
evidence (97017#0195) and addressed the set of pre-circulated eleven A3
colour attachments (97017#0193) and responded to extensive questions
from the commissioners.  Further copies of the sets of the colour
attachments were circulated at the meeting (97017#0193 and
97017#0353).
Following the hearing, Diane Lucas forwarded an updated version of
her written evidence (97017#0356) which incorporated a reference to the
definition of the “hogback” land formation, in response to a
question raised by the commissioners, as well as the additions to her conclusions
as had been outlined at the hearing.
In response to a question from the commissioners, Mr Enright
commented on the matter of the ownership of the land in question.  The
commissioners would also ask the applicant to comment on this aspect later in
the hearing.
Adele Mohi-McGoverin addressed the
hearing and spoke to a power point presentation, which incorporated notes and a
video (97017#0375 and 97017#0241).  She responded to questions from
the commissioners.
Rose Mohi addressed the
hearing and spoke to a power point presentation (97017#0286) and
associated notes (97017#0358).  She responded to questions from the
commissioners.
A copy of notes from kuia Peggy Kurupai Nelson dated 29.9.1998 had
been referred to at the hearing – these were forwarded by Diane Lucas (97017#0355).

Megan Exton, Legal Counsel, circulated
and read her Submissions (97017#0244) on behalf of her clients
P and A Maloney who were long term local residents, but who were unable to
be at the hearing.  She responded to questions from the commissioners.
Marei Apatu, Te Kaihautū, Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga addressed the hearing on behalf of Te Taiwhenua o Heretaunga
Trust.  He was joined by Ngaio Tiuka - Ngāti Kahungunu Iwi

He also tabled a copy of the Cultural Impact Assessment document (97017#0332)
– Te Matā…Te Mata te Tipuna.  He also noted the
apology made by the Council.  He responded to questions from the
commissioners, highlighting that the path forward needed to be robust.
Ngāhiwi Tomoana – Chairman
of Ngāti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated joined Marei Apatu and Ngaio
Tiuka.
Ngāhiwi Tomoana responded
to questions from the commissioners and noted the reluctance of hapū to
give up their secrets and sacred sites.  Discussions between the land
owners, council and iwi needed to take place so each site was appropriately addressed.
Bruno Chambers addressed the committee
and backgrounded his family’s association with the area, having farmed it
for five generations.  He responded to questions from the commissioners; acknowledged
the council’s apology; and supported a call for a plan change and for
policies that were not open to interpretation.

The Reporting Planner, Consultant Philip Brown presented his response (97017#0301) to the matters raised in

In response to an earlier question from the commissioners, Mr J
O’Shaughnessy, Group Manager: Planning & Regulatory Services, HDC addressed
the matter of who owned the land.  It was owned by Mr and Mrs Drabble, with

agreement with the land owners for council to undertake the emergency
works.  There was also a verbal agreement with the land owners that if
consent was granted for the remedial works, that council will be able to
undertake those works.
The commissioners thanked all parties for their attendance at the
hearing and again thanked Waimārama Marae for hosting this second day of
the hearing.
Councillor Bayden Barber, Waimārama Marae and local hapū
