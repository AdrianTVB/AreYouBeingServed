JULY  2019  REPORT  ON  THE  HASTINGS  DISTRICT  YOUTH  COUNCIL 
ACTIVITIES 

(Document 19/652) 

Revitalisation of Albert Square 
 
The Open Spaces Planning Manager, Rachel Stuart, addressed the meeting.  She 
displayed an aerial view of Albert Square and updated the Hastings District Youth 
Council  (YC)  members  on  her  discussions  with  the  landowner  about  the 
development  of  this  area.    The  landowner  had  been  receptive  to  the  ideas  that 
were being proposed.  
 
Rachel  would  come  to  each  YC  meeting  and  welcomed  any  further  ideas  and 
would report back to the members on developments. 
 
 
Monthly Reports 
 
Only one YC report had been received this month - from Charliot Miller (CG-14-33-
00149). 
 
 
Proposed New Youth Council Logo 
 
The Youth Development Co-ordinator, Ang Hughes, advised that the logo concepts 
had been delayed and were not ready to be considered at this meeting.  They were 
due to be available on Friday, 5 July and Ang would then email them to members 
for comment via the YC Facebook group. 
 
 
1737 Need to Talk Helpline 
 
The  Youth  Development  Co-ordinator,  Ang  Hughes,  spoke  to  the  information  that 
had  been  sourced  from  the  Ministry  of  Health  website  (CG-14-33-00151)  and 
information  about  the  1737  Helpline  (CG-14-33-00152).    Ang  had  also  spoken  to 
Sharon  the  Clinical  Director  of  the  1737  Helpline  regarding  the  background  to  the 
establishment of this service and the name. 
 
Ang  had  passed  on  concerns  raised  by  young  people  regarding  the  delays  in 
having someone answer calls to this helpline.  Sharon had asked Ang to pass onto 
the  YC  and  other  young  people  -  please  don’t  hang  up  if  they  experience  delays 
when calling this helpline. 
 
The Council Liaison, Councillor Dixon, reported that this matter had been raised by 
the  YC  representative  on  the  Hawke’s  Bay  Health  Consumer  Council,  Daisy  Hill.  
The Health Board will follow this up and provide feedback to the YC, via Daisy. 
 
 
2019 Youth Council Annual Plan 
 
The YC members went through the Annual Plan entries for dates in September to 
December 2019 and discussed whether they wanted to be involved in activities that

3 

were happening on those dates.   
 
  10 September (World Suicide Day) – YC members would like to learn how to 

talk to other young people who were having problems and needed support.   

  It was suggested that: 

  a letter be sent from the YC to schools regarding the Youth to Youth training; 
  people  could  also  attend  community  training  workshops  in  the  evenings  (in 

Hastings, Flaxmere and Havelock North).   

  Daisy Hill could raise this with the HB Health Consumer Council as they may 

be able to assist with the training side of this event. 

  12 October (2019 Council election) – Council’s Electoral Officer, Jackie Evans, 
and  the  Registrar  of  Electors  from  the  Electoral  Commission,  Michelle  Jaggard 
addressed the YC and responded to questions from the meeting. 

  The meeting was advised that: 

 

if  the  YC  wanted  to  hold  any  election  related  events  care  needed  to  be 
taken.    Council  resources  could  not  be  used,  including  the  YC  Facebook 
page (unless the YC was only encouraging people to vote at the election). 
they needed to be fair and invite all candidates to any event. 

 
  Michelle Jaggard could come to schools and speak and also remind students 
to  fill  in  enrolment  forms  (if  they  are  17  yrs  old  now)  or  they  can  go  to  the 
vote.nz website to enrol. 
this was still a postal election process. 

 
  people enrolled by 16 August will get packs sent out to them.  If not enrolled 
by  then,  they  will  need  to  cast  a  special  vote  –  this  can  be  done  at  any 
council  offices  in  the  district  or  via  an  election  van  that  will  come  out  to 
schools. 

  Michelle  asked  for  ideas  to  help  make  young  people  aware  of  the  election 

process and encourage them to vote. 
 

Given the work involved in holding an election related event, due to the constraints 
that would be imposed on the YC members in doing so (as outlined above), the YC 
unanimously decided not to hold any events for this election.  However, they would 
use  the  YC  Facebook  page  to  promote  enrolment  and  voting  in  the  election  and 
some of the Meet the Candidate evenings that were being run by others. 
 
Ondre  Hapuku-Lambert  and  Gurjas  Sekhon  joined  the  meeting  during  discussion 
on Item 5. 
 
Charliot Miller left the meeting at 4.37pm. 
 
  19 September (Talk Like A Pirate Day – partnered with Canteen) 
  A letter to be sent out to local schools to background what was planned and that 

it was in support of Canteen. 

  28  September  (Relay  for  Life  Mental  Health)  –  YC  decided  not  to  undertake 

any events in relation to this activity. 

  11  October  (Coming  Out  Day  –  in  support  of  LGBTQ  community)  -  YC 

decided not to undertake any events in relation to this activity. 

  16  October  (World  Food  Day  –  partnered  with  Multicultural  Assn)  –  YC  to 

contact the Association and see what they are planning and assist if possible. 

  31 October (Halloween) – YC would discuss on Facebook page. 
  8 December (Schools Out) - YC decided not to undertake any events in relation 

to this activity. 

  It was suggested that during the warmer weather the YC could look at holding an 

outdoor movie or an alternative event at Albert Square.
