Contributory Fund
The Chair, Councillor Beaven invited
Trudy Kilkolly and Brent Chamberlain to present on this paper, but highlighted
that this item, the Contributory Fund certainly caught the attention of the
media.  Discussions traversed.
·      Cr Beaven gave a background on the concept of a contributory fund
and mentioned that this has been in discussions by the Joint Committee for a number
of years.
·      He further reiterate that key decision today is to determine
whether a contributory fund needs to be established, how the fund would be
operated, managed and governed.
Brent Chamberlain and Trudy Kilkolly presented on the background,
interpretations, content, merits of establishing a Contributory Fund.
·      The contributory fund is a collection of funds from ratepayers and
potentially other external funding agencies in advance of expenditure being
required to implement the Strategy.
·      The costs of the proposed interventions of the strategy were
estimated by Tonkin and Taylor in 2016 to be between $130 - $285 million,
noting this was a high level estimate.
·      Any funds collected for the contributary fund pre-intervention
will reduce the need for debt funding and reduces future interest costs. It
is highlighted that the contributary fund will not be able to cover the full
cost of works but it will be used to offset debt.
·      It was proposed that the three partner Councils begin collecting
from ratepayers from the 2021/22 year to commence payments into the
contributory fund
·      The contributary fund can be used for the “Public
Good” component of costs and protection of the TLAs and HBRC’s
infrastructure.
·      The private good benefit will be collected at a later stage
through a targeted rate from those landowners receiving the benefit, when
there is certainty of timing and value of the physical intervention.
·      One option for the operation of the Contribution Fund is that all
expenditure for the implementation of the strategy will be paid out of the
contributory fund – with contributions from private landowners and
others added to the fund. This would create administrative convenience by
having one source of funds for paying contractors etc.
·      No decision has been made on “Public vs Private”
splits and no decision yet of the value on the “infrastructure
protection” that the TLAs would contribute.
·      A Draft Coastal Contributory Fund Rules Deed was tabled as a
working draft and to seek feedback on.
·      Key suggestions for discussion include that HBRC administer the
fund, that HBRC’s Investment Policy would apply, and that any
expenditure from the fund is pre-approved by all Councils.
·      The Committee agreed that a contributory fund is established and
also agreed to the need for more detail on how the fund could work and to
bring this as a package to public consultation in mid to late 2020.
·      The Chair received the comments of the committee members who were
all supportive to move the coastal hazards strategy forward, while seeking finer
detail on the allocation of costs before implementation can begin.
·      There is much more detail to be worked through but the committee
recognises that starting now to build a contributory fund is the right thing
to do.
·      The details associated with the contributory fund will be the
focus of a public consultation in 2020.
·      Cr Beaven thanked the Joint Committee members for showing their
support and leadership, and for taking these next steps forward.
·      Proposed to have a full joint workshop by respective councils
around how the fund would be operated, managed and governed.
CLI113/19
Resolutions
That the Clifton to Tangoio Coastal Hazards Strategy Joint Committee:
1.      Receives and notes the “Contributory Fund”
report.
2.      Recommends to Hawke’s Bay Regional Council, Napier City
Council, and Hastings District Council that a Coastal Contributory
Fund be established.
3.      Recommends to Hawke’s Bay Regional Council, Napier City
Council, and Hastings District Council that Hawke’s Bay Regional
Council be the Council that administers the Fund on behalf of Hawke’s
Bay Regional Council, Napier City Council and Hastings District Council.
4.      Recommends to Hawke’s Bay Regional Council, Napier City
Council, and Hastings District Council that they consider rating towards the public
good component of the implementation strategy in the 2021-22 financial year
at the rate to be determined and subject to public consultation at a
preferred option of $15.00 per rating unit, with amount to be reviewed
annually thereafter.
5.      Notes and receives the Contributory Fund Rules Deed as an early
draft and acknowledging more work to be done.

Community Consultation – Options
and Risks around LTP Alignment
Simon Bendall, Project Manager gave a
summary and background on the paper and highlighted that at the last meeting,
it has been reported that 12 months had been added to the timeline to provide
additional time for the Design Workstream to complete their work.
Discussions traversed:
·
As a consequence of the amended timeframe,
public consultation on the Strategy has been delayed from Q1 2020 to the
first quarter of 2021 which means that it would align with Council
consultation on Long Term Plans.
·
The Joint Committee requested an assessment of
the risks this might present and requested TAG to present options to deal
with these risks.
·
TAG have identified three options for the
Joint Committee’s consideration; Aligned consultation, Delayed
consultation and/or Staged consultation.
TAG Group has
recommended the Staged Consultation approach (that initial concepts are
tested with the community ahead of LTP consultation in 2021 and remaining
matters are consulted on as a separate LGA special consultative process after
2021 LTP consultation is fully completed)
·
Stage 1 would commence in July/Aug 2020 and
Stage 2 in late 2021 after Long Term Planning Consultation has been
completed.
·
The TAG Group considers that this approach
strikes the best balance and avoids risks associated with shortening project
timelines or combining with other significant consultation processes.
·
TAG Group is mindful that the consultation
process needs to be appropriately resourced and carefully planned and
executed.
·
If the Joint Committee agrees with the Staged
Consultation process, TAG will further develop detail for the Joint Committee
to review.
·
This will include subject areas that can be
developed for consultation to occur in July/August 2020, how the outcome of
that consultation can be incorporated into 2021 LTP review processes, timing
and detail of process to occur post 2021 LTP and a revised project plan to
account for the staged consultation approach.
·
The Joint Committee agreed to adopt the Staged
approach as recommended by TAG and sought that a revised project plan is developed.
CLI114/19
Resolution
That the Clifton to Tangoio
Coastal Hazards Strategy Joint Committee receives and notes the “Community
Consultation – Options and Risks around LTP Alignment”
report.

Project Manager's Update
Simon Bendall provided an update on the
work currently undertaken with discussions highlighting:
·
As part of the Staged consultation process,
TAG will produce a revised project plan which will be presented at the next
meeting.
Tom Belford
left the meeting at 11.55am.
·
Simon Bendall gave an update on the meetings
he and Chris Dolley had attended on 28 May in Wellington.
·
Meetings were held with Insurance Council of
New Zealand, Central Government (including Treasury, MfE and other government
officials) and Local Government New Zealand.
·
Insurance Council of New Zealand – the current coastal work undertaken are very well
regarded by the Insurance industry and helpful in assisting for making key
decisions based on risk.
·
Insurance companies quickly recognise risks
and as an example certain areas in other jurisdictions had their insurance
cover removed due to risks of flooding events, but once council resolved
those risks, the cover was then re-established.
·
Simon and Chris will present the Strategy
project to the Insurance Council of New Zealand’s Personal Loans
Committee in September, attended by all major insurers who issue policies in
home and contents cover.
·
Central Government:  Very concerned around the national costs on coastal projects.
Progress is being made on Central Government’s role but no immediate
outcomes at this stage.
·
There may be an opportunity to present options
to Central Government to assist by presenting a live project with specific
challenges requiring central government support.
·
LGNZ:  CEO, Malcolm Alexander and senior
staff were in attendance. Keen to support and partner with this Committee on
engagement with Central Government. This conversation is continuing – a
next step is likely to be attendance by LGNZ President Dave Cull at a Joint
Committee meeting, but also ongoing collaboration at a staff level.
