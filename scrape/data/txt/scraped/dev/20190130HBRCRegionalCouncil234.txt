Blair O’Keeffe, HBRIC Ltd Chief
Executive, introduced Amon Nunns of Bell Gully (legal) and Peter Boyce from

negotiations with preferred providers are under way
·
Communications and stakeholder advisor RFPs
are out now
·
the IPO transaction design will be initiated
shortly
·
Clarification of rights of shareholders to
offer advice and influence Company decisions including strategic operational

Council will be able to exercise its rights as majority shareholder in a
publicly listed company, and the Port Companies Act
·
information such as corporate responsibility can
be articulated through the product disclosure statement required as part of
the listing porcess
·
Operational decisions will continue to sit
with the Port’s Board of Directors, as they do now, and the Board may
consider shareholder views when making strategic operational decisions but is
not bound to agree or implement those wishes or views
·
Board of Directors is responsible to all
shareholders for compliance with the Statement of Corporate Intent
·
HBRIC Ltd councillor directors and potential conflict
of interest issues relating to decisions made by Council and/or decisions
that HBRIC directors are required to make in the “best interests of the
company” in accordance with the Companies Act

legislation that the Port Board of directors is required to act in accordance
with

influence the Board through director appointments

Project Update” staff report.
6.
CCO Corporate Structure to Support Proposed Napier Port IPO Transaction
Blair O’Keeffe introduced the item,
outlining the options presented as developed by Bel Gully and PWC as advisors
to HBRIC Ltd. Queries and discussions covered:
·
Seeking guidance and feedback ahead of a final
Council decision as a lot more work to be done in relation to legal and
taxation considerations for different models
·
One objective of this company to support the
listing exercise itself and take it to market
·
Advisors reviewed an extensive range of
available options in terms of taxation and legal aspects, as well as
reviewing liability implications and regime for HBRIC and Port directors, and
ensuring that there are no adverse tax implications
·
Principle of HoldCo is that it operates as a
single entity (HoldCo & PortCo with a shared Board of Directors) rather
than two separate companies, to list/sell and issue shares for simplicity
·
How the mechanics of appointment of directors
to HBRIC Ltd, HoldCo and the Port would be transacted, in accordance with the
company’s constitution
·
HoldCo would report to the market, and the
shareholders, as the listed company
·
Councillors did not agree to undertake
investigations into listing shares on the Australian Stock Exchange, as
there’s been no prior mention made of that possibility and because
consultation was solely based on NZX listing so re-consulting with the public
would be required – and no investigations have been undertaken into
doing that
·
Requirements for consultation and
communications with the public in relation to the corporate structure
·
Rights of Council as shareholder and company
accountability and how those might potentially be changed through the
corporate structure that supports an IPO transaction
·
Napier Port continues to operate as the
operational company, required to have a Board and HoldCo would be the administrative
company
·
Keep in mind that not solely commercial
environment, and consider political and public environment of local
government
·
Current structure of Council as 100% owner of
HBRIC, and the necessity (or not) for HBRIC in relation to potential tax
implications and HBRIC being able to undertake other activities, for example
commercial forestry investment
·
Only Napier Port can create new shares
RC5/19

the attached Bell Gully - PWC memorandum dated 22

after further work has been completed.

requires public consultation under section 56 of the Local Government Act.
