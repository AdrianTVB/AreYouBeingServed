Reserve Management Plan
(Document 18/1271)
Mayor Hazlehurst advised that an email (CFM-17-66-19-179)
had been received from Patricia Reddy (Submission No. 41) withdrawing her submission.
David Renouf (1) spoke to his submission and highlighted the following points:
·
Displayed at the meeting
was a map (CG-14-39-00012) of Hastings from 1938 when streams ran through the
City.
·
The name of the stream running through
Cornwall Park be investigated and corrected.
·
To improve water quality
need to increase quantity of water into the stream.
·
Undertake to seal the pond
because significant amount of seepage occurs out of pond.
·
Install sediment weirs
near the stormwater discharge points and regularly remove collected sediment.
·
Request daily, weekly, annual maintenance
programme be instigated.
Barbara Mawson (12) spoke to her submission and highlighted the following points:
·
Pathway improvements
including at the Tomoana Road entrance become a higher priority in the Action
Plan to improve accessibility for people with mobility issues.
·
Supported the inclusion of
shade and seating in the new children's playground.
·
Accessibility compromised
with a number of walkways being disconnected with  high
kerbs.
·
Improve accessibility for people with mobility
issues.
·
Bus stop relocated from the Osmanthus Garden.
·
Toilets closed at 6pm during daylight saving.
·
Timeframes for improvements 4-7 years away and
would like brought forward.
Rebecca Hill (36) spoke to her submission and highlighted the following points:
·
Requested that the Cornwall Park Playcentre be
retained within its current building on the Park.
·
Relocation of the Playcentre would incur
substantial financial costs.
·
Requested renewal of the
lease to Cornwall Park Playcentre and change of lease terms to enable the
hire of the building to other not for profit users.
·
Endorse expansion of
building as recommended by officers.
·
Change of park and zoning.
·
Area that would be playcentres to have set up
as playcentre and place that community could hire.
·
Recently been reroofed and repainted –
unaware of any major maintenance required.
Oliver Styles (18) spoke to his submission supporting the Cornwall Park Playcentre
lease renewal in the current building.
President, (Margaret McBride), Cornwall
Park Playcentre (34) and (56) together with Rebecca
Hill spoke to the
submission and highlighted the following points:
·
Requests the renewal of the lease to Cornwall
Park Playcentre.
·
Change the lease terms to enable the hire of
the building to other not for profit uses.
·
Subsequent to submission officers have
proposed an extension option.
·
Preferred option would be renewing lease but
would work with Council’s extension option to retain the Playcentre in
the park.
·
Would need secure long term lease or ownership
of the Playcentre.
·
Exclusive use of building during playcentre
hours.
·
The plan is currently high level and happy to
work with Council in design options
·
Discussion with cost sharing – Playcentre
would seek to contribute to extension
·
One year extension was acceptable while this
feasibility work could be done.
·
Committed to being in Cornwall Park.
·
Would be a financial burden to the Cornwall
Park Playcentre to relocate.
·
Playcentre obtains some funding from the
Ministry of Education but a move such as this would require a huge effort in finding
a contributor outside of MOE or Playcentre Aotearoa.
·
Current lease was for 12 years and renewal
would need to be at least that.
Mayor Hazlehurst and Chief Executive withdrew from the meeting at
10.00am.
Deputy Mayor Kerr assumed the role of Chair.
Hana Ruth (37) spoke to her submission supporting the Council option to renovate the
building to accommodate playcentre and community and lease renewal in the

·
Requested the sealing of the gravel
pathways throughout the park which were unsafe especially in winter.
·
Requested that the Native Garden area
be beautified with native flax planting that produce flowers and nectar
providing food and shelter for wildlife - removal of plants has led to weeds.
·
That it is fundamental that all three

currently dirty and draw many negative comments.
·
While supporting the restoration
programme, requested in the first instance the implementation of a regular
maintenance and cleaning programme for the waterbodies.
·
Request the provision of more shrubs
and trees around the waterways for wildlife, to offer protection from
predators and children.
·
The park is full of weeds, and there
is concern about the outsourcing of the maintenance to another company.

to this premier playground.
·
One of three main assets of Hastings being the
Hawke’s Bay Opera House, Town Clock Tower and Cornwall Park.
·
Playcentre should be restored and be used by
everybody.
·
Gardeners need to have their time to garden
without worrying about rubbish bins.
·
Suggested a sensor be installed in the glass
house as a security during the night.

Conclusion of morning verbal
submissions
The Parks Planning and Development
Manager, Ms Stuart displayed a powerpoint presentation  (CFM-17-8-10-19-111)
providing an overview of the consultation and submissions to the Cornwall
Park Reserve Management Plan.
As an administering body under the Reserves Act 1977, the Hastings
District Council was required to prepare Reserve Management Plans for the
reserves under its management.  The Plans identify issues, objectives
and policies for the use, development, management and protection of the
reserves within the District.
Fifty seven written submissions were received.
The Draft Cornwall Park Reserve
Management Plan was prepared taking into account all the identified issues
and opportunities raised during the initial consultation regarding:
·
Waterbodies
·
Children’s Playground
·
Toilet Facilities
·
Historical and Cultural Values
·
Tree Management
·
Osmanthus Garden
·
Bird Aviary
·
Parking and accessibility
·
Commercial Activities
·
Former Tea Kiosk Building; and the
·
Cricket Green
Councillor Barber left the meeting at
12.00.
_________________________
The meeting adjourned for lunch at 12.00pm
and reconvened at 1.00 pm
_________________________
Playcentre New Zealand, Pauline
Gibbons (47) spoke to her submission and
highlighted the following points:
·
Supported  Playcentre
lease renewal in current building.
·
The idea of an extension is well worth further
investigation and scoping. Some main points of interest would be:
-
the amount of investment needed by the
Playcentre, and the ownership status
-
how the building (both the Playcentre “end”
and the communal part) would comply with Ministry of Education requirements,
and align with best practice in Early Childhood Education
-
the redesign of the outdoor area to meet
playground standards, and be of a good size
Councillors Nixon, Schollum and
Redstone rejoined the meeting at 1.10pm
-
the process that would be necessary if the
Playcentre, in the future, wished to open for  additional sessions
-
the process for regular occurrences such as
Playcentre meetings, working bees, parent education workshops, etc –
where the centre members would need access to the kitchen/toilets, outside of
session times.
·
At this point the changes you suggest for the
Draft Cornwall Park Reserve Management Plan, granting one year’s
extension to the lease for the Playcentre during which time a feasibility
investigation is carried out, seem a wise way to proceed.
·
NZ Playcentre Federation Building Fund
$200,000, is an amount that can be applied for annually, but only once for
each project.
Krystal Neho spoke on behalf Amy
Hopkinson-Styles (49) supporting the Cornwall
Park Lease renewal in the current building.
Peter McNab (50) spoke to his submission and highlighted the following points:
·
Did not support
the introduction of angle parking in Roberts Street due to health and safety
risk.
·
Reversing out of
angle park could be an issue as the driver’s view of a small child
would be obstructed by the passenger door.
·
Provision of angle
parking in his opinion would not significantly increase the provision of
parking.
Linda Bruce (41)  displayed a powerpoint presentation and spoke to her
submission and highlighted the following points:
·
Cultural values included in the Cornwall Park
and all public spaces in the district.
·
Cultural mission statement that guides
aesthetics.
·
Our public spaces should
represent this community and this place.
·
Use the concept of a heart line to encircle
the park with kowhaiwhai design.
·
Improve contemporary social and cultural wellbeing:
-
through innovative planning and design achieve
-
a sympathetic balance of the retention of
historic features and new developments guided by bi-cultural philosophy and
contemporary aesthetics
to ensure public spaces reflect our diverse community and are relevant to the
needs of today’s young and future generations.
·
Under Recreation and Leisure add:
-
include the provision of play experiences
throughout the park to encourage adventure/exploratory/discovery/free play.
-
EIT Idea School would be open to future collaboration with council –
stronger working relationship.
This concluded the verbal submissions.
Councillors Harvey and  Nixon
left the meeting at 2.00pm
Mayor Hazlehurst requested Ms Stuart to
address Remedy 17 recommendations while submitters on the Cornwall Park Lease
were still present.
The Parks Planning and Development
Manager, Ms Stuart advised that 35 submissions had been received
relating to the provisions included in the Plan with regard to the former tea
kiosk building and the lease to the playcentre.  There was also a desire
from some submitters to restore the historic building for future generations.
Officers had met with an architect and builder to consider
possible solutions that could address the issues raised.  The building
could be restored and upgraded and the Playcentre could build an extension at
the rear of the building.
A feasibility study would be required to investigate
possible solutions and it was recommended that the lease of the Playcentre be
extend to September 2020.
REMEDY 17 : SECTION 5.3 LEASES
The Council amended 5.3.9 of the
Officer’s recommendations as follows:
5.3.9      Investigate the feasibility, including financial implications of:
(a)
building a purpose built playcentre adjacent to the
existing building and the practicality of shared community use of the
existing building;
(b)
relocation of Cornwall Park Playcentre to a new park
location; and
(c)     the
costs of restoring the building back to its original condition and upgrade
for either community use or commercial use; and potential investment
partners, sponsors and community funds to contribute; and report back to
Council 6 months prior to the expiry of the extended lease on 10 September
2020.
The Council agreed with the
remainder of the recommendations for Remedy 17.
The Parks Planning and Development Manager, Ms Stuart continued
the powerpoint presentation (CFM-17-8-10-19-111).
Ms Stuart advised that as a result of submissions made, the
programmed capital expenditure remained unchanged.  However if all
submissions requesting additional facilities were allowed, this would
increase the unprogrammed capital expenditure by $1,330,000 plus $80,000 over
the current Long Term Plan period.
Following discussion and inclusion of additional items a revised
budget was presented.

The Council agreed to adopt the
revised budget below bringing forward funding for:

The meeting then addressed submissions
requiring minor amendments and the Officer Recommendations regarding the
Remedies.
REMEDY 1: INTRODUCTION SECTION
The Council agreed with the
Officer’s recommendation that the Plan
be amended by adding the following wording:
In December 1898,
it was announced in the Hastings Standard that J N Williams (1837-1915) had
“presented the Borough with a public park” from recorded
proceedings at a Hastings Borough Council meeting.
The Hastings
Borough Council minutes record this in December 1898:
“That this Council of behalf of the residents of
Hastings accent Mr J N Williams a hearty vote of thanks for his magnificent
gift of a piece of land to the Borough for the purpose of a Park and
recreation grounds.”
However, in what appears to be pencil and in different
handwriting, a sentence was later added to the above minute after “Mr J
N Williams”: “as representing the transferring of the
property”.
This likely explains the reason why Archdeacon Samuel
Williams’s (1822-1907) daughters, Mrs Lucy Warren and Miss Lydia
Williams, donated Cornwall Park to the people of Hastings in 1901 (Samuel was
J N Williams brother-in-law) -  J N Williams did not own the land, but
was “representing” his brother-in-law, Samuel, who it appears did
not want any publicity.
Samuel worked closely with his brother-in-law J N
Williams, whose name appears on legal documentation connected with Cornwall
Park.
At the opening of Cornwall Park in November 1905,
Hastings mayor, W Y Dennett, stated:
“The park was a family gift of the Williams’,
and although Mr J N Williams did not personally give the land, it was through
his instrumentality that it was given to the people of Hastings.”
The Council agreed with the
Officer’s recommendation to Amend Part 2 Social & Cultural Values
by adding the following new section.
“Improve
Contemporary Social and Cultural Wellbeing
Through
innovative planning and design achieve a sympathetic balance of the retention
of historic features and new developments guided by bi cultural philosophy
and contemporary aesthetics to ensure public spaces reflect our diverse
community and are relevant to the needs of today’s young and future
generations”.
REMEDY 2: ORGANISED SPORT
The Council agreed that no change be made
to Policy 1.2.7 of the Plan and it remain as below.
“1.2.7
Create two grass embankment areas on the perimeter of the Cricket Green to
provide enhanced spectator experience and viewing and seating opportunities”.
REMEDY 3: DOGS
The Council agreed that Policy 1.3.2 of
the Plan be amended as below:
“1.3.2  Require dogs to be
retained on a lead at all times when in Cornwall Park, and that improved signs be erected”.
REMEDY 4: BUILDINGS
The Council agreed that Policy 2.2.7
of the Plan be amended as below.
“2.2.7  Keep the use and condition
of buildings on the Park under review to ensure they meet the needs of park
users and the community and remain relevant to the Park.  Where
buildings are no longer well utilised, an alternative compatible community
use will be found, or the building may be removed”.
REMEDY 5: FENCES AND WALLS
The Council agreed that Policies 2.3.2
and 2.3.4 of the Plan remain as below and a new Policy 2.3.6 be included in
the Plan.
“2.3.2
Install mechanisms to keep unauthorised vehicles
out of the Park in order to protect amenity features and to ensure the safety
of Park users.
2.3.4   Reinstate the
side panels with commemorative plaque between the pillars at the Fitzroy Road
entrance to the Park.
2.3.6   Maintain and protect the historic stone
walls and seats within the Park for future generations to enjoy.”
REMEDY 6: SECTION 2.4 LIGHTING
The Council agreed that Policy 2.4.3
of the Plan be retained as below.
“2.4.3
Provide amenity lighting along
the pathway leading to the Cricket Pavilion, from Roberts Street and Tomoana
Road”.
REMEDY 7: SECTION 2.5 PLAYGROUNDS
The Council agreed that the following
be included in the Plan under Goals & Key Actions “Recreation &
Leisure”
·
Recognise and provide for the provision of
play experiences throughout the Park to encourage adventure, exploratory,
discovery and free play.
The Council agreed that as the
submission of Patricia Reddy (55) had been withdrawn, the
officer’s recommendation below, could not be included in the Plan.
However, officers to note that it is the request of Council that the timber
from the redwood tree be used to build something that can later be reinstated
back into the playground, such as in the free play area, furniture or art
work.
“Children’s
Playground
In
order to make optimal use of the existing site, and improve accessibility and
integration with the former tea kiosk building the Plan proposes the removal
of the redwood tree.  This is not a protected tree and has recently been
assessed as showing signs of decline in some of its branches.  Council
will retain the timber from the tree to be used to build something that can
be later reinstated back into the playground where it can be enjoyed by
future generations, such as in the free play area, furniture, artwork or
other natural playground equipment in consultation with mana whenua, local
artists and community groups”.
_________________________
The meeting adjourned for afternoon tea at 3.00pm

stone seats, walls and bridges within the Park”.

of the Plan be amended as follows:
“2.10.4    Formalise
parallel parking spaces along Cornwall Road and Roberts Street with
road markings to ensure optimal use of the space and identification of
pedestrian accessways. Only consider the provision of marked angle parking in
the future if required to meet additional demand in the future, and if
health and safety risks can be addressed through improved road design”.
REMEDY 11: SECTION 2.12 PATHWAY
NETWORKS
The Council agreed that Policy 2.12.2 of the Plan remain as below and that
pathway
improvements be brought forward to 1-3 year priority and that arborists will
be involved in the development of any new pathways to ensure there is no
impact on the health of the trees.
“2.12.2 Provide the following
new pathways within the Park to enhance accessibility and safety, as
accessibility to park features and facilities:
(a) Cricket Green Walkway, along
Tomoana and Cornwall Road boundary
(b) Rose Garden Link along Roberts
Street
(c) Ornamental Lake Perimeter Walkway
(d)
Coronation Fountain Connectivity Pathways”
REMEDY 12: SECTION 3.1 TREES AND
GARDENS
The Council agreed that a new Policy be added to Section 3.1 and Section

REMEDY
15: SECTION 4.1 CULTURE AND HERITAGE
The Council agreed that the
Legislation section be amended to include the following wording:
“Heritage
New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014
The Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014 replaced the Historic Places Act 1993 on 20 May 2014.  As stated on the Heritage New
Zealand Pouhere Taonga website, the new legislation reforms the governance of
the New Zealand Historic Places Trust in line with its status as a Crown
entity and streamlines many procedures under the Act. For example, the new
archaeological provisions are intended to improve efficiency, reduce costs,
and improve alignment with the Resource
Management Act 1991.
As
owners of heritage places (such as buildings, parks, reserves,
infrastructure, and archaeological sites), local authorities must meet
relevant statutory requirements and comply with plan rules for land they own
and administer.  Local authorities can set a good example for heritage
management in the district or region (and to the wider community) by ensuring
that their own assets have been researched and evaluated for their heritage
values, and are managed in accordance with conservation principles”.
The Council agreed to the
following wording in regard to the Coronation Fountain:
“King George
V Coronation Drinking Fountain
The King George V
Coronation Drinking Fountain is on the New Zealand Heritage List/Rarangi
Korero as a Historic Place Category 2 (List Number 1078).  The fountain
was constructed in 1911 to mark the coronation of King George V”.
The Council agreed to amend the Historical and Cultural Values
paragraph incorporating the words “and protecting” as follows:
“As an important community and
sporting attraction, the Park must be managed in a way that is sensitive to
changing user demands and expectations, whilst still retaining and protecting
those heritage features that contribute to its unique character”.
The Council agreed to amend Section
2.12 – Path Networks and add the following paragraph:
“A new pathway
is proposed to recognise and enhance the accessibility and importance of the
Coronation Fountain within its surroundings.  The extent of the Heritage
New Zealand Pouhere Taonga List entry for the Coronation Fountain includes a
2 metre curtilage from the platform’s edge and in all direction.
Proposals near the Fountain will require careful planning and implementation
in order to appropriately relate to the Coronation Fountain, including the
curtilage and wider setting.  Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga will
be consulted on this matter”.
The Council agreed to amend Section
4.1 – Cultural & Heritage
Significance as follows:
“A number of parks
within the District contain sites of heritage significance, such as
buildings, landscapes, structures, archaeological sites and trees. Many of
these are listed in the Historic Places Trust Register, and include
registered historic places, historic areas, registered Waahi Tapu sites and
recorded archaeological sites. Trees of outstanding heritage values are also
identified under the Notable Trees Registration Scheme. Many of these
heritage resources have protection under the New Zealand
Heritage List/Rārangi Kōrero, or the District Plan.
There are a number of sites of
historic heritage within Cornwall Park, including 13 Outstanding Trees as
identified in the Hastings District Plan; the King George V Coronation
Drinking Fountain is on the New Zealand Heritage List/Rārangi
Kōrero as a Historic Place Category 2 (List Number 1078),  as well
as historic stone bridges over the waterways and stone seats and walls
throughout the park made of earthquake rubble in the 1930s.
The Council agreed to Amend Policy 4.1
by deleting the incorrect policies 5.1.1 – 5.1.4 and replacing with the
following:
Objective
4.1.1   To
identify, maintain and protect any historic sites and features of special
community interest so as to preserve and enrich public awareness of our
heritage.
Policy
4.1.2   To
ensure the protection and preservation of all historic and cultural features,
and where appropriate display information as to their significance.
REMEDY 16: SECTION 5.1 MAINTENANCE
The Council agreed to the
amend  5.1 - Management
and Maintenance as follows:
“From February 2019 the maintenance of all the
District’s parks, reserves and open spaces, including Cornwall Park
is contracted by Council to an external contractor.  The
contract includes mowing, sportsground preparation, toilet cleaning, and playground,
gardens and tree maintenance to specified Levels of Service; and takes into
account the objectives and policies of this Plan. These service levels
will be reviewed on an annual basis to recognise the importance of Cornwall
Park as the premier park of the District; and as new facilities are added to
the park or increased levels of service are agreed, these will increase
annual operating costs”.
REMEDY 18: SECTION 5.5 NETWORK UTILITIES
The Council agreed that Section 5.5 – Network Utilities remain
unchanged in the Plan.
“Parks are often
seen by Utility Operators as convenient places to locate infrastructure such
as drains, water supply and electricity substations. Such infrastructure can
however have an adverse impact on the character of a park and its open space
qualities and make the maintenance of it more difficult and costly.
Given That Cornwall Park is a premier park of
the District, and its primary use for sport and recreation, it is not
considered to be a desirable location for the location of network utilities”.
REMEDY
19: SECTION 5.9 RESERVE BOUNDARIES
The Council agreed that the maintenance of the area behind Eversley Rest Home would have
regard to the habitat of the wildlife in this area and be carried out as part
of regular park maintenance, but that Council would work with residents of
Eversley Rest Home to beautify the back wall of the utility shed with a
mural.

Reserve Management Plan funds in years 2018-21, with unspent funds retained
for future works in Windsor Park.
REMEDY 1:
SECTION 1.0 INTRODUCTION
D)
That the submission of Hugh McBain
(Submission 40) requesting that the history section be amended be allowed in part insofar as Page 6 ‘History of Cornwall
Park’ be amended by deleting the words shown as struck out and adding
the words shown in red italics as follows:
James Nelson Williams
(1837–1915) was one of the so-called “apostles” who in 1864
leased twelve smaller blocks within the 19,385 acre (7,844ha) Heretaunga
Plains Block.  James purchased his two blocks in 1870, calling his new
estate Frimley. As Hastings was not a government-planned town it relied on
the generosity of private landowners to donate land for public uses, such as
schools and recreation areas.
In December 1898, it was announced in the Hastings Standard
that J N Williams (1837-1915) had “presented the Borough with a public
park” from recorded proceedings at a Hastings Borough Council meeting.
The Hastings Borough Council minutes record this in
December 1898:
“That this Council of behalf of the
residents of Hastings accent Mr J N Williams a hearty vote of thanks for his
magnificent gift of a piece of land to the Borough for the purpose of a Park
and recreation grounds”
However, in what appears to be pencil and in
different handwriting, a sentence was later added to the above minute after
“Mr J N Williams”: “as representing the transferring of the
property”.
This likely explains the reason why Archdeacon
Samuel Williams’s (1822-1907) daughters, Mrs Lucy Warren and Miss Lydia
Williams, donated Cornwall Park to the people of Hastings in 1901 (Samuel was
J N Williams brother-in-law) -  J N Williams did not own the land, but
was “representing” his brother-in-law, Samuel, who it appears did
not want any publicity.
Samuel worked closely with his
brother-in-law J N Williams, whose name appears on legal documentation
connected with Cornwall Park.
At the opening of Cornwall Park in November
1905, Hastings mayor, W Y Dennett, stated:
“The park was a family gift of the
Williams’, and although Mr J N Williams did not personally give the
land, it was through his instrumentality that it was given to the people of
Hastings.”
On 21
December 1898, James – who was a Councillor – announced at a
Hastings Borough Council meeting he was gifting 20 acres (8ha) of his Frimley
Estate as a Public Park. The area fronted Tomoana Road, and the Ruahapia
creek ran through the property. The land was accepted with a vote of thanks
by the Council.
A deed
covering the gift of the Park from James Nelson Williams to the Hastings
Borough Council was drafted in March 1900, setting out the conditions
attached to the plantings in the Park.  Thomas Horton, who owned a
nursery in Pahiatua (and later Hastings), supplied trees and hedges free of
charge for preliminary plantings at the Park. Most of them were deciduous and
were planted around the boundary.
E)
That the submission of Linda Bruce
(Submission 41) requesting that the Goals and Actions

Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014
The Heritage
New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act
2014 replaced the Historic
Places Act 1993 on 20 May
2014.  As stated on the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga website, the
new legislation reforms the governance of the New Zealand Historic Places
Trust in line with its status as a Crown entity and streamlines many
procedures under the Act. For example, the new archaeological provisions are
intended to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and improve alignment with the Resource Management Act 1991.
As
owners of heritage places (such as buildings, parks, reserves,
infrastructure, and archaeological sites), local authorities must meet
relevant statutory requirements and comply with plan rules for land they own
and administer.  Local authorities can set a good example for heritage
management in the district or region (and to the wider community) by ensuring
that their own assets have been researched and evaluated for their heritage
values, and are managed in accordance with conservation principles.
Amend Page 16
as follows:
King George V Coronation Drinking Fountain
The
Coronation Fountain Lions Monument has a Category II New Zealand Historic
Places Trust classification. The King George V Coronation Drinking Fountain is on the
New Zealand Heritage List/Rarangi Korero as a Historic Place Category 2 (List
Number 1078).  The fountain
was constructed in 1911 to mark the coronation of King George V.

‘Historical and Cultural Values’ as follows:
As an
important community and sporting attraction, the Park must be managed in a
way that is sensitive to changing user demands and expectations, whilst still
retaining and protecting those heritage features that contribute to its
unique character.
Amend Section
2.12 to add the following paragraph:
A new pathway is proposed to recognise and enhance the
accessibility and importance of the Coronation Fountain within its
surroundings.  The extent of the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga
List entry for the Coronation Fountain includes a 2 metre curtilage from the
platform’s edge and in all direction.  Proposals near the Fountain
will require careful planning and implementation in order to appropriately
relate to the Coronation Fountain, including the curtilage and wider
setting.  Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga will be consulted on this
matter.
Amend Section
4.1 Cultural & Heritage Significance as follows:
A
number of parks within the District contain sites of heritage significance,
such as buildings, landscapes, structures, archaeological sites and trees.
Many of these are listed in the Historic Places Trust Register, and include
registered historic places, historic areas, registered Waahi Tapu sites and
recorded archaeological sites. Trees of outstanding heritage values are also
identified under the Notable Trees Registration Scheme. Many of these
heritage resources have protection under the Historic Places Act New Zealand Heritage List/Rārangi Kōrero, or the District Plan.
There are a
number of sites of historic heritage within Cornwall Park, including 13
Outstanding Trees as identified in the Hastings District Plan; the
Coronation Fountain which has a Category II registration

2.2       Buildings
The former tea kiosk building
overlooking the Cricket Green is owned by Council. The Cornwall Park Playcentre lease to occupy the former
tea kiosk building expires in 2019.  The lease provides them with
the exclusive use of the building and an adjacent 350m2 of open
space.
While Council recognises the
long history that Playcentre has with this building, its use does not meet
the primary purpose of a Recreation Reserve under the Reserves Act
1977.  A playcentre should be located on a Local Purpose Reserve.  Following a decision on the long term use of the building,
Council may need to apply to the Minister of Conservation to change the
classification to reflect the approved use.

shared community use of the existing building;  (b) relocation of
Cornwall Park Playcentre to a new park location; and (c) the costs of
restoring the building back to its original condition and upgrade for either
community use or commercial use; and potential investment partners, sponsors

petition of Karen Down in the name of her late son, Matthew.
The petition prayer “That
the House of Representatives urgently pass legislation to introduce random
roadside drug testing to reduce the escalating road toll from drugged drivers,
which resulted in 79 fatal crashes in 2017 and exceeds the number caused by
those impaired by alcohol”.
The meeting agreed that
Council supported the petition and gave an undertaking to make it available in
the Public Libraries.  Any Councillor who wished to support the petition
was encouraged to sign it.
