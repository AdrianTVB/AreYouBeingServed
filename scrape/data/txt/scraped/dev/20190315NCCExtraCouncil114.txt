1.1   Purpose
of Report
The purpose of the report is
formally approve the underlying information and approve key decisions from
Council for the development of the draft Annual Plan 2019/20.
At the meeting
A substitute motion was
proposed in relation to part f. of the officers’ recommendation
regarding recycling services. It was agreed that this was appropriate
considering flexibility will be required due to frequent changes in this
space.
It was noted that some
constituents had expressed concern around Annual Plan hearings being replaced
with public consultation evenings. Councillor Boag advised that she hoped
hearings would be reinstated in future.
In response to questions from
Councillors it was clarified that the change in cash flow noted between the
Long Term Plan and the draft Annual Plan is predominantly as a result of
lower than estimated section sales in Parklands and also takes the mediation
settlement into account.

Settlement

3.1   Purpose
of Report
To present an alternative option
for funding the confidential mediation settlement of 7 Humber Street
(Waterfront Apartments).
At the meeting
A number of Councillors
expressed their dissatisfaction with current legislation which leaves
ratepayers to bear the brunt of ‘leaky homes’ defect-related
claims. It was noted that the claim is lodged in the High Court and the
building company is therefore named as a matter of public record.
In response to questions from
Councillors the following points were clarified by management:
·
Council currently has one outstanding claim as noted in the
Annual Report. It is therefore in the best interests of the ratepayers that
the Waterfront Apartments settlement figure is not disclosed and remains
confidential.
·
Any party that discloses confidential terms of the mediation
settlement will consequently be held to account; Councillors were advised to
notify the Mayor or Chief Executive if they believe there has been a breach.
·
The terms of the builder’s settlement will also be
confidential and there will be no opportunity to pursue further compensation
from any parties that have settled through mediation.
·
A report will be brought to Council shortly to consider a remit
asking central government to reassess the issue of joint and several
liability in these matters. It was noted that central government had
discussed this previously, but decided to consider reforms within the building
legislation instead. The Mayor confirmed that there will likely be enormous
support from other Councils for this remit.
Council resolution
Councillors
Price / Brosnan
That Council:
a.     Note that
the claim for 7 Humber Street (Waterfront apartments) was successfully
settled through mediation within the delegation provided to the Chief
Executive at the Extraordinary Council meeting held 8th February
2019.
b.     Note that
the details of the settlement are confidential.
c.     Revoke
resolution (b), (c), (d) and (e) of item 1 made by the Council on
8 February 2019 as the Council wants to change how the settlement is to
be funded.
d.     Resolve
the following funding for the mediation settlement:
i.      Resolve
that funding of the mediation settlement be comprised of a split between
Parklands Residential Development reserve fund and a reduction in costs and
increased revenues within Council activities.
ii.     Utilise
the provision made within the annual accounts 2018/19 in relation to the
claim.
iii.    Note
that any successful claim against Riskpool will result in funding being
returned to the Parklands reserve and that otherwise the reserve will not be
specifically replenished for the funds taken out.
iv.    Note
compliance with section 80 of the Local Government Act 2002 has been met in
relation to the deviation from the Liability Management Policy (by setting
out in the report the departure, the reasons for it, and noting that there is
no intention to amend the policy).
v.     Note
that the proposed funding will not impact rates for 2019/20.
Carried
The meeting closed at 1.20pm.
