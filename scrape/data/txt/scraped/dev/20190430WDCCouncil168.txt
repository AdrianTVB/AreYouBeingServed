That Council support the LGNZ AGM remit proposed by Whakatāne District Council. 

Draft Remit 

This Remit is in two parts; 

1)  That LGNZ acknowledges that the New Zealand Transport Agency’s (NZTA’s), Code of  Practice 
for Temporary Traffic Management (CoPTTM) is a comprehensive and robust document, and 
that NZTA ensures the CoPTTM system is regularly reviewed, refined and updated. However, in 
light  of  the  recent  road  worker  fatalities  LGNZ  requests  NZTA,  in  partnership  with  Road 
Controlling Authorities; 

a)  Review afresh its Code of Practice for Temporary Traffic Management (CoPTTM) to satisfy 

themselves that; 

i)  The  document  provides  sufficient  guidelines  and  procedures  to  ensure  approaching 
traffic are given every possible opportunity to become aware of the worksite ahead and 
to respond appropriately and in a timely manner 

b)  Review its CoPTTM Training System to ensure; 

i)  Trainers are sufficiently qualified and adequately covering the training syllabus 

ii)  Site  Traffic  Management  Supervisors  (STMS’s)  and  Traffic  Controllers  (TC’s)  are  only 

certified when they can demonstrate competence in the application of CoPTTM. 

iii)  A  robust  refresher  programme  is  in  place  to  ensure  those  in  charge  of  Traffic 

Management on worksites remain current in the required competencies. 

c)  Review  its  Site  Auditing  requirements  to  ensure  the  traffic  management  at  worksites  is 
independently  audited  at  a  sufficient  frequency  to  ensure  compliance,  and  that  a 
significantly robust system is put in place to enable enforcement of compliance. 

2)  That LGNZ takes steps to remind its members of their duties with respect to their role as Road 

Controlling Authorities including; 

a)  Appointing and sufficiently training and resourcing a Traffic Management Co-ordinator to 
ensure  their  obligations  under  the  HSWA,  with  respect  to  traffic  management,  are  being 
met. 

b)  Adequately  resourcing  and  undertaking  audits  of  road  work  sites  to  ensure  compliance 

with CoPTTM
