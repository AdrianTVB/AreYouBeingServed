Annual Plan Submissions 2019/20
(Document 19/552)
Copies of the Officer Comments (CP-01-02-19-122)
had been previously circulated to submitters speaking.
PRESENTATION OF VERBAL SUBMISSIONS
The following submitters spoke to their
submissions.
Submission
No. 26 - John Buck spoke to the submission requesting
capital funding support (cash or in kind) of $2,000,000 for the Cranford
Hospice building project.
Councillor
Poulain joined the meeting at 9.10am
Mr Bishop
advised that due to a technicality the resource consent had not yet been
issued, however a revised plan was to be submitted in the near future.
Mr Buck advised
that the Hawke’s Bay District Health Board had not indicated that they
would financially support the project.
Submission No. 16 - Tony Lane spoke to
the submission requesting funding to carry out essential maintenance work on
the Waimarama Hall including electrical work, hot water supply, chairs,
kitchen floor, ovens, fridge, dishwasher and kitchen benches.
Mr Lane also displayed photos (CP-01-23-1-19-48)
of the Waimarama/Maraetotara Memorial Hall
maintenance items that required attention.
Mr Hosford advised that the Hall was a community building on
Council land and therefore was not recorded on the Council Asset Register, or
part of Council’s building maintenance and renewal programme.
Submission No. 22 - Vicki Butterworth displayed a powerpoint presentation (CG-14-26-00110) outlining a
proposal and funding request for $100,000 toward the Bay
View to Whirinaki Cycleway extension of Hawke’s Bay Trails, as approved
by New Zealand Cycle Trail.  This was for a 7.5km shared coastal trail,
including a dedicated swing bridge for cycling and walking.
Ms Butterworth advised that if the New
Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) became involved financially this may reduce
the amount of $100,000.  However, the expectation was that the project
be co-shared and local co-funding be sought.     The NZTA
was not considered part of co-share funding as it was a Government Department
however, if the trail sat within a State Highway it could be funded through
the Agency.
Submission
No. 21 - Jane Mackersey, Havelock North Business Association displayed powerpoint presentation (CP-01-23-2-19-14) outlining a range of concerns and suggestions regarding waste,
recycling and smoke free initiatives within the village.  The following
points were highlighted:
·
Proposed 60 leased carparks.
·
Parking wardens to monitor
Monday–Saturday on both mornings and afternoons to deter long stayers.
·
Council undertake a
week long Parking Survey in the Village as previous survey in December 2017 was
not an accurate overview.
·
Current recycling station – Council
already own land and could relocate to Romanes Drive.
·
The Village and all Council carparks, reserves
and buildings become smokefree in 2020.
·
Reconfigure kerbs in The Village for safe
wheelchair access to footpath in consultation with mobility transport
operators.
·
Relocate Council’s Parks depot from
Anderson Park and Recycling Station to Romanes Drive to create more leased
carparking at Anderson Park.
Officers made the following comments in
response to the submission:
·
A report on the relocation of the recycling
station at Martin Place would be presented to Council in regard to future
locations and whether it would be manned or unmanned.
·
Additional electric car chargers were being
researched.
·
The request for more bike stands around the
village and sites was being investigated.
·
Whilst some of the carpark suggestions
submitted had merit, they would require considerably more investigation and
planning.
·
Retailers desire to have carparks that are
free rather than leased.
·
A parking study of Havelock North was
scheduled to be undertaken in 2020.
·
Council’s Smokefree Policy was also due
for review.
Submission No. 37 - Keith Newman displayed powerpoint presentation (CP-01-23-2-19-4) providing an
overview to his submission for the establishment of a rock revetment
structure at Cape View Corner to protect the vulnerable piece of coast line.  The
vision for a significant entry statement to the coast was also overviewed.
Mr Newman circulated information at the
meeting (CP-02-23-2-19-5).
Submission No. 29 - Stephen Daysh (on behalf of Lowe family interests) displayed powerpoint
presentation (CP-01-23-1-19-45) in regard to the proposed amendments to the
Development Contributions Policy and sought the formulation of a Development
Agreement with Council for the Iona development.  Circulated at the
meeting was an Iona Structure Plan of the area (CP-01-23-2-19-12).
Councillor Barber joined the meeting
at 10.30am
Mr Daysh requested that Council
agree in principle and ask Council staff to prioritise:
·
Signing the Memorandum of Understanding;
·
Negotiating a comprehensive development agreement; and
·
Investigate how Council could use powers under
the Local Government Act so development could be built and be fairly and
equitably paid for.
Mr Daysh advised that he had worked with the
Queenstown Lakes District Council on a similar development and suggested
officers may like to look at their Development Contributions Policy as a
reference.
_____________________
The meeting adjourned for morning tea at 10.45am
and reconvened at 10.55am
_____________________
Councillor
Kerr joined the meeting at 10.55am.
Submission
No. 17 - Nick Richards spoke on behalf of the
Mayfair Community in regard to safety improvements to Bill Mathewson Park and
speed calming measures for Willowpark Road and Cunningham Crescent adjacent
to the park.  Mr Richards advised that the community were happy to defer
the footpath and bund work to enable work on the two carparks to commence.
The option of angle parking had been discussed with the Council’s
Roading Team.
The two speed
humps have proved not to be a deterrent to encourage safer driving and he did
not agree that narrow roads reduced speed.
Ricardo Fox – Principal, Mayfair
School also spoke in
support of the submission with five near misses on Willowpark
Road.  Mr Fox advised that the school were happy to give up some land
for angle parking.
It was noted that there was no Traffic
Management Plan for Mayfair School and this could be included with other
school traffic management plans.  Officers would undertake an updated
traffic count for the area.
Councillor Dixon having previously
declared a conflict of interest withdrew from the meeting table at 11.10am for
Submission No. 14
Submission No. 14 - Colin Hurst (Heretaunga
Croquet Club) spoke to his submission requesting a contribution of $50,000
toward clubroom refurbishment (12.5% of total refurbishment).  The Clubroom,
formerly a packing shed does not meet the requirements of a modern sports
facility.   National and International tournaments were held at the
Club.  The Clubroom is on Council owned land.
Councillor Dixon rejoined the meeting
11.20am
Submission
No. 1 - Lou Klinkhamer  spoke to his
submission requesting funding support for the use of
the Keirunga Homestead and Quilters Cottage.
It was noted
that all lessees of buildings were responsible for internal costs while
Council looked after the building exterior.  It was outlined that this
request could create a precedent and would have a potential impact on
ratepayers.
Submission
No. 19 - Charles Daugherty displayed a powerpoint presentation (CP-01-23-1-19-46) providing an overview on how the Council could support and give
effect to the work of the foundation and the Hawke’s Bay Biodiversity
Strategy via the endowment fund, operational support and specific project
support.
The idea behind the partnerships is
for funding to be applied for specific projects, which Biodiversity
Hawke’s Bay would administer. They provide a level of security and
governance for funding bodies and also meant that community biodiversity
projects did not have to become legal entities themselves to apply for funds
but could do so through Biodiversity Hawke’s Bay.
Submission
No. 9 - Ron Wilkins on behalf of Hastings and
Districts Greypower  Association requested that the
bus shelter on Russell Street be enclosed to protect the public from the
elements of the weather.
Mr Wilkins also
requested that free parking in the central shopping area of Hastings from
9.00am to 12noon be provided to Gold Club holders displaying their cards on
the car dashboard.  Palmerston North and New Plymouth have approved this
system which encourages Gold Card Holders to leave home.
Mr Wilkins
advised that the traffic jam that was created at the Havelock North roundabout
could be alleviated with a marked crossing away from the actual entry into
the street.  If a crossing was possible he suggested that the speed
limit be reduced to 30km.
Submission
No. 31 - Wi Huata (Nga Marae o Heretaunga) circulated
information (CP-01-23-1-19-51) on a Global Haka Event.  Mr Huata spoke

$112,000 toward a proposal to develop a Marae Blueprint Plan seeking to
unlock business opportunities along with educational and training
opportunities.
Following the
success of the Civic Centre Pou project and Marae Fit projects Mr Huata asked
that Council join in facilitating a Marae Blue Print Plan.
Councillor
Kerr withdrew from the meeting at 12.05pm.
Submission
No. 35 - Sharnita Raheke spoke on behalf of the
Raureka Community Trust submission requesting the development of a community plan for Raureka.  Ms Raheke believed that
having a Community Plan would enable:
·
Investigation of options for a Community Hub;
·
Provide a focal point and facility for local
community activity;
·
Bring residents, business community and
smaller organisations together; and
·
Improve the quality of life in their
community.
Officers
confirmed that $120,000 funding had been approved last year in the Long Term
Plan and supported the development of a community plan which could be
accommodated within the budget and work programme for 2019/20.

The meeting agreed to fund
approximately $15,000 to $20,000 for replenishment work from existing budgets

Corner (recognising there were multiple considerations).
Submission No. 15 –
Hawke’s Bay Mountain Bike Club - The
Parks and Services Manager, Mr Hosford advised that the work on Te Mata
tracks had been put on hold as the Te Mata Park Trust had some logging work

at the Global Haka presentation officers be instructed to advise the submitter
that he present to the HDC : Maori Joint Committee who could help inform the
scope and what was being proposed and make a recommendation to Council.
If the HDC : Maori Joint Committee gave direction for the project, and
Council agreed to the proposal, some funding was available from existing
budgets.
It was also recommended that Nga Marae

marketable product for the district.
Submission No. 32 - Bridge Pa Community
Plan - The Council’s Pou Ahurea Matua Principal
Advisor: Relationships, Responsiveness & Heritage, Dr Graham outlined
that the approach has been to capture the history of Maori/Pakeha at Bridge

milestone of the project.
Discussion also took place at how the
community views could be captured more efficiently to bring together a
completed community plan within budgetary allowances.
The meeting agreed to partially
support the submission up to $25,000 funded from existing budgets, subject to
officers working with the submitter on completing the remaining elements and
deliverables of the project.
ITEMS NOT RECOMMENDED BY OFFICERS
Submission No. 1 – Lou

fees for the Clubrooms and Council had already invested $35,000 in the
performing arts to the Society for rebuild.

funding for the Keirunga Homestead and Quilter Cottage as it would create a
precedent and that had the potential to impact heavily on the rate
payer.  The Society had the ability and opportunity to fundraise.
Submission No. 34 - Akina Park –
The Parks and Services Manager, Mr Hosford
advised that Akina Park was scheduled for upgrade and renewal in
2022/23.  To bring the renewal forward would result in the deferment of

additional funds allocated.
