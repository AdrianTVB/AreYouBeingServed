Central Hawke's Bay Wastewater
Discharge Update
James Palmer tabled a memo received from Central Hawke’s Bay
District Council in relation to the CHB Wastewater Project progress and
timelines (following).
Malcom Miller
updated the committee on the progress to date with discussions highlighting:
·
The Reference Group has been established, consisting
of a wide representative group to look into long term solutions for
Waipukurau, Waipawa and Otane treatment plants.
·
Range of options tabled for consideration by
the Reference Group, which will report back to the Environmental Court in
June 2019.
·
Funding of the project has been identified as
a significant risk and an activity that requires strategic thinking now to
allow the solution to progress once approved.
·
Indication that CHB Long Term Plan funds are
inadequate to fund the long term solution and an LTP amendment will be
unavoidable.
·
The working group has been told to consider
all options.  In time costs will be discussed and whether the community
will be able to afford the funding.
·
Concerns raised in relation to the deadlines
set, however confident that the deadlines will be met.
·
The Reference group dismissed direct discharge
into fresh water and total discharge to land, and looking at options between
the two, considering the waste stream, waste disposal processes and the
actual discharge.
·
Aiming to find a single solution for
Waipukurau, Waipawa and Otane, combining the three discharges to a single
treatment plant.

Management of Public use of River Berm
Lands update
Chris Dolley introduced David Carruth,
Manager Regional Assets who gave a progress update and overview of next
steps.
·
Widespread trials of berm management options have
been conducted on the Ngaruro including hay bailing, planting natives and
retiring the land.
·
A memorandum of understanding between HBRC,
CHB Rotary River Pathways Trust and CHB Adult Riders Club has been drafted

Clive River dredging
David Carruth gave an update on dredging
work in the Clive River with discussions covering:
·
Because dredging is not a permitted activity
for flood control, a consent is required which will require obtaining updated channel survey information
and development of a dredged channel design.
·
Dredging is a niche contracting market and
contractors will be engaged through a competitive tender process.
·
Looking into suitable options to dispose of
the silt as sea disposal is not palatable.
·
A 1993 survey report on sediment in the lower
reach of Clive River will be distributed to the Committee members
·
Past assessment indicated that a flood gate
would not be sufficient to remove the sediment, however technology changes
and the option may be re-investigated
·
It was agreed that an item outlining the work
associated with such an investigation into options to augment better flow,
including resourcing implications, be provided to the Committee to enable
councillors to consider whether this work should be progressed and/or
prioritised
ESC6/19
Resolution
That the Environment and
Services Committee receives and notes the “Clive River
Dredging” staff report.

HBRC,
TLA and Private Landowners' Obligations for
Maintaining Waterways
Chris Dolley explained this this paper
was previously presented to a 2018 Corporate and Strategic Committee
meeting.  Discussions traversed:
·
C&S meeting requested information on
proactive measures to prevent further obstruction and sedimentation of
watercourses
·
everyone who has property with river frontage has
obligations to maintain the rivers and remove sedimentation and other raw
materials to minimise erosion
·
Council spends around $2.4m per year across
various schemes, mostly on preventative maintenance including removal of
trees and planting
·
Order to carry out clean-up or maintenance
process is not used by this Council, rather a ‘service requests for
works’ is sometimes used
·
Council powers under the Land Drainage
Act
·
Some works include three yearly detailed
condition assessments of rivers, post flood inspections and public reports of
issues, buffer zone maintenance, channel and drainage channel maintenance,
berm, stop bank and drain mowing, weed boat cutting and rock and akmon
protection works
·
a paper on shading and vegetation of riverbanks
will be presented to a future committee meeting

2018 Esk Flood Event
Craig Goodier presented a summary
overview of the March 2018 flood event with discussions covering:
·
Next steps are to update the Esk flood model
to incorporate new developments in modelling, to develop updated flood hazard
maps for Est Valley, and to review hydrologic data to develop the
stage-discharge curves which underlie flood frequency analysis for the Esk
and Mangaone catchments.
·
CDEM is carrying out a cost benefit analysis
of setting up a text warning system for residents in the Esk Valley.
·
Developing a hydrodynamic model of the Magaone
River near Rissington to enable flood hazard mapping for the Mangaone River

Seagrass in the Porangahau Estuary
Anna Madarasz-Smith updated the committee on the opportunities and
issues in the Porangahau Estuary with discussions highlighting:
·
NZ Herald article from NIWA in January 2019
indicated that Hawke’s Bay has some of the highest water temperatures in
NZ
·
NIWA will launch a glider on a 4-6 week voyage
25 February to investigate conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen
levels, water temperature, etc in the whole of Hawke Bay.
·
Scientists found patches found Seagrass in the
Pōrangahau Estuary, an important habitat for many marine species,
supporting primary productivity, stabilising the sediment, increasing
biodiversity and providing food and habitat for many other marine species
·
Declines of seagrass are well documented nationally,
and recent regrowth of seagrass has been seen in some places.
·
Water quality at Pōrangahau site is
marginal for long-term persistence of seagrass
·
NIWA reports that due to increasing levels of
bacteria associated with faeces, longer-term persistence of seagrass in the Pōrangahau
Estuary is likely to be marginal under current water quality conditions,
meaning that it is at risk of loss
·
Several projects initiated in the Porangahau
catchment that will in time improve the water quality and have multiple
benefits for estuarine health, diversity and recreation

Resolution
That the Environment and
Services Committee receives and notes the “Seagrass in the
Porangahau Estuary” staff report.

Te Kaha Hawaikirangi will be joining Napier Port as an
Environmental and Cultural Advisor so this is the last meeting he will be
attending.
Wairoa Hard –presentation on mapping of the Wairoa Hard as part of the
HotSpot fund last May 2018, highlighting:
·
NIWA multibeam survey of the Wairoa hard is
the most significant mapping undertaken in the Hawke’s Bay Coastal Marine
environment.
·
The main aim was to investigate the
composition of the sea bed – extensive parts of the “Hard”
still hard and muddier in deeper offshore areas
·
Next steps to look at the substrate and investigate
the juvenile habitat, predominantly for commercial fisheries
·
2019-20 financial year, doing a similar study of
the “Clive Hard” – south from Cape Kidnappers
·
Trying to tie in with NIWA’s existing
programs
·
May hire PhD student in the 2020-21 financial
year to develop a hydrogen model for Hawke Bay by using data obtained from
sea bed characteristics
Lake Whakaki – Iain gave a quick update on the consents process with
discussions covering:
·
The window of opportunity to obtain MfE
funding for Whakakī is closing. Before a draft FIF application can be
submitted to MfE, all consents must be obtained. Staff are working hard to
obtain support from the last 15% of affected parties, to assist the resource
consenting process.
·
HBRC Consents team processing the resource
consent application, including signed affected party approval forms (85% of
the total needed).  MfE have requested 6 weeks to work with HBRC to
finalise the application and for their legal team to review the application
and establish a Deed.  The Deed must be obtained by 30 April 2019.
If not, this funding will be lost. Therefore, Council has to submit a draft application by Friday 15 March.
Lake Whatuma – an update outlined that key stakeholders and iwi agreed a
collaborative approach to understand local community and iwi vision and
values, prior to the establishment of any management plan for the lake. A
large portion of the lake is privately owned by a consortium of 15
individuals. Possibility that the lake could be purchased so a lake/land
valuation has been completed, and the findings are currently being reviewed
by the lake/landowners.
·
The Committee members thanked Te Kaha for his
work and contributions to Council and wished him well with his new
appointment at Napier Port.
·
A paper was requested on “Hawke Bay
Hard” to provide clear direction on the start and end of the current
