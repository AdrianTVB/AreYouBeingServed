Report from the 4 June 2019 Māori
Committee Meeting
Mike Mohi introduced the item, held at
Whakaki Marae just outside Wairoa, which was well attended by locals including
members of the Wairoa District Council Maori Standing Committee. It was
suggested that having the relevant TA Maori Committee representatives attend
meeting at marae assists with understanding the different functions and
responsibilities of the district and regional councils. Some concerns raised in
the CHB representative’s report, which may need to be addressed to CHB
District Council, will be discussed by the CE, Council Chair and Mr Mohi at a
future meeting in Porangahau. August meeting will be the last of the
triennium for the Māori
Committee, and Mike Mohi advised he will not be continuing as a member after
the elections.
