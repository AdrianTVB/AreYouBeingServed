Freshwater Security Scheme
Tom Skerman introduced Ellen Humphries, who last presented a draft
of the scheme and policy to councillors at a 30 January workshop. Discussions
and queries covered:
·
The policy outlines how specified Long
Term Plan funding will be allocated and administered
·
Two parallel work streams look strategically into the
future as well as responding to urgent community needs – Regional
Freshwater Assessment ($500,000) and Ready Reaction Fund ($4.5 million)
·
first two projects under the Ready Reaction
Fund are the Heretaunga Flow Enhancement and Tukituki Water Security projects
·
Feedback from January workshop taken into
account in the updated document, including alignment of the conflicts of
interest clauses with the Code of Conduct and relevant staff policies, clarification
that enabling high value land use is not the same as grandfathering current
land use, and enable opportunities to leverage central government funding
·
Water security related applications to
Provincial Growth Fund in conjunction with region’s territorial
authorities
·
Governance of the fund to be by the
Environment and Services Committee, which will recommend budget allocations
to Council
·
Scope of the work streams and funding
available not initially fixed to any particular schemes however that will
change as investigations and feasibility studies are undertaken to enable
allocating funds to specific schemes
·
The wording used in the Scope section reflects
the LTP decisions made as consulted on
·
Opportunities in the Wairoa area
·
Umbrella for this scheme is water security and
key thrust of assessment is around demand and supply
·
Water augmentation is adding water to the
system through a range of means including water savings, conservation and
efficiency, and water storage for multi-value benefits including for
ecosystem health
·
Water use efficiency is being driven by work
with irrigators through the planning and regulatory framework and runs alongside
this policy
·
Scheme criteria to ensure that consideration
is given to the wider community values for water as a taonga
·
This policy is for administrative guidance
rather than a publically contestable fund, in contrast to the Erosion Control
Scheme
·
The Scheme and its policy will likely be
reviewed in light of PGF funding application decisions once those have been
made
RC37/19
Resolutions
That Hawke’s Bay Regional Council:
1.      Receives and notes the “Freshwater Security Scheme”
staff report.
2.      Agrees that the decisions to be made are not significant under the
criteria contained in Council’s adopted Significance and Engagement
Policy, and that Council can exercise its discretion and make decisions on
this matter without conferring directly with the community and persons likely
to be affected by or to have an interest in the decision.
3.      Adopts the Freshwater Security Scheme Policy as amended as agreed.
4.     Directs

Establishment of a Council Controlled
Organisation to Facilitate a Potential Minority IPO of Napier Port
Jessica Ellerm introduced the item, in which staff recommend that
Council does establish a new CCO, with discussions and queries covering:
·
Company constitution will include shareholder
rights provisions and will be ratified by Council
·
Reporting on the themes and substance of
submissions rather than numbers and percentages, or ‘votes’
·

should the IPO transaction proceed.
RC40/19
Resolutions
That Hawke’s Bay Regional Council:
1.      Receives and notes the “Establishment of a Council
Controlled Organisation to Facilitate a Potential Minority Initial Public
Offering of Napier Port” staff report.
2.      Notes that a consultation process has been carried out by Council,
in accordance with the Local Government Act 2002, covering the proposal to
establish a new Council Controlled Organisation.
3.      Notes the receipt of submissions and findings from the
consultation process that has been undertaken in respect of the proposed
establishment of a new company (being a 100% subsidiary of Hawke’s Bay
Regional Investment Company (HBRIC) pre-listing and a majority owned
subsidiary of HBRIC post-listing), which will result in the establishment of
a new Council Controlled Organisation under the Local Government Act 2002.
4.      Notes the separate but related Council report titled “Officers’ Analysis of Submissions Received on
Establishing a new Council Controlled Organisation”.
5.      Notes that the decision that Council is tasked with making on
whether to approve the establishment of a new Council
Controlled Organisation (CCO) is part of a sequence
of decisions. Once the decision to approve the
establishment of a new CCO is made, an amendment to the Long Term plan will
provide for the CCO pending a final decision to proceed with the Initial Public
Offering transaction.
6.      Agrees that the most appropriate corporate structure for the
listed entity is the new Council Controlled Organisation as consulted on in
the consultation proposal.
7.      Agrees that a new Council Controlled Organisation should be
established, following any decision by Council to proceed with a minority
listing of shares in Napier Port.
8.      Delegates the authority to HBRIC to establish the new Council Controlled
Organisation for the purposes of offering a minority stake in Napier Port,
subject to Council making a final decision to proceed with the minority
Initial Public Offering of Napier Port.
9.      Requests the newly established Council Controlled Organisation be
named Napier Port Holdings Limited.
10.    Notes that as part of the amendments to the Council’s 2018-28
Long Term Plan, amendments will be made to reflect the intended establishment
of the new Council Controlled Organisation.
11.    Instructs that Council staff advise submitters on the proposal to
establish a new Council Controlled Organisation (CCO) of the resolutions made
by Council at this meeting in relation to the establishment of the new CCO
and shareholder protections.

Shareholder Protections - Napier Port
Holdings Limited and Port of Napier Limited
Blair O’Keeffe introduced the item, which was contingent on
the decision to establish the CCO and is contingent on Council’s final
decision whether or not to proceed with the IPO transaction. Queries and
discussions traversed:
·
The remuneration paid to directors once for
role on both Napier Port Holdings and Napier Port boards, including
Shareholder Appointed directors
·
Shareholder appointed directors, and whether
those appointed will be two councillors
·
The responsibilities and accountability of all
directors under the Companies Act, the Port Companies Act and NZX listing
rules.
RC41/19
Resolutions
That Hawke’s Bay Regional Council:
1.      Receives and notes the “Shareholder Protections - Napier
Port Holdings Limited and Port of Napier Limited” staff report.
2.      Approves,
subject to a decision on whether to proceed with a minority Initial Public
Offering of Napier Port Holdings Limited (NPH), the following protections to
be established in the formation of NPH and, as necessary, within the
constitution of NPH and Port of Napier Limited (as appropriate):
2.1.      Protections
to prevent Council Parties' share in Napier Port Holdings Ltd being diluted
to less than a majority of 51 per cent.
2.2.      All
and any future share issues by Napier Port Holdings Ltd must be offered to
ALL shareholders on a pro rata basis (as a further protection for all
shareholders and to give the Council Parties the ability to ensure its
ownership position is not eroded by subsequent share issues).
2.3.      The
boards of Napier Port Holdings Ltd and Port of Napier Ltd shall be the same,
such that they operate as one company in the eyes of all shareholders.
2.5.      Information
sharing protocols and a confidentiality agreement are to be established
between Napier Port Holdings Ltd, Port of Napier Ltd and Council Parties to
provide a framework for Regional Council having access to information about
Napier Port. The categories of information that could be passed to the
Council Parties would need to be agreed to by the independent directors of
both NPH and Napier Port and also fall within the permitted parameters of the
NZX Listing Rules and the Companies Act. The categories of information could
include information that the Council Parties require to comply with their own
legal, financial report and tax obligations and other non-price sensitive
information. The negotiation and finalisation of the Information sharing
protocols and Confidentiality Agreement would be delegated by the Council
Parties to the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council Chief Executive.
3.      To add the following as additional items that must be approved by Napier Port Holdings Limited's
(NPH) shareholders (beyond those provided by existing law as matters
requiring shareholder approval and subject to those applicable laws,
including the NZX Listing Rules) if any of the following matters were
proposed by NPH or Port of Napier Ltd. These items are recommended for the
benefit of all shareholders.
3.1.      A
"major transaction" (as defined in the Companies Act), being a
transaction such as the acquisition or disposal of assets or incurring
liabilities or obligations with a value of more than 30 per cent of the value
of NPH's or Napier Port’s gross assets (i.e., with no deduction for
liabilities). This is a reduction from the Companies Act threshold which
requires a vote on a transaction at the threshold of more than 50 per cent of
a company’s gross assets. This reduction in the threshold provides
greater oversight, influence and visibility of major transactions to all
shareholders.
3.2.      Any
future amendment of the constitution of Napier Port (noting that protection
already exists for any amendments to the constitution of NPH)
3.3.      Any
transfer or issue of shares in Napier Port, other than to a directly or
indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of NPH. This ensures that Napier Port
remains 100% controlled by NPH unless the required shareholder approval is
obtained, and maintains the premise of NPH and Napier Port operating as one
company and investment for all shareholders.
3.4.      A
restrictive covenant or encumbrance will be registered in favour of the
Council Parties restricting the use of land at Napier Port’s main site
to activities associated with operating a Port. This covenant or encumbrance
will also restrict any future sales of the main site to transfers where the
Council Parties have consented to such transfer
3.7.      Notes,
that in respect of any of the above rights to be entrenched in the
constitutions as part of these recommendations, Ministerial approval will be
required.
3.8.      The
finalisation and detailed implementation of the recommendations outlined are
delegated to the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council Chief Executive, working
with HBRIC Ltd and Napier Port Holdings Ltd, and subject to a Council
decision on whether to proceed with the Initial Public Offering transaction.
Dick/Belford
CARRIED
2.4.      Two
appropriately qualified non-independent directors should be appointed to the
Napier Port Holdings Ltd (NPH) and Port of Napier Ltd boards as Majority
Shareholder-Appointed Directors to provide direct insight into Napier Port Holdings
Ltd (NPH) and Port of Napier Ltd board matters (noting that the directors
appointed to the board of NPH must operate in the best interests of NPH,
rather than any one group of shareholders, as required by the Companies Act).
Such appointments will need to be made in accordance with Council's director
appointment policy.

Amendment to HBRC’s 2018-2028
Long Term Plan to Provide for the Napier Port Initial Public Offering
Jessica Ellerm introduced the item, for
the adoption of the amendments to the LTP as Council’s primary planning
document, which must be made prior to Council’s decision whether to
proceed with the IPO. As LTP amendment was part of the Our Port consultation
process councillors have been asked to reflect on the feedback received
previously through that process. It was further noted that Council has
received Audit clearance on the amendment this morning.

3.      Notes that a proposed 2018-2028 Long Term Plan amendment was
consulted on as part of the special consultative procedure on the four
options to fund the growth of Napier Port entitled ‘Our Port –

option selection decision report which outlined the advantages and
disadvantages of the reasonably practicable options before making its
in-principle decision to proceed with further work to refine its preferred
option.
5.      Notes that Council has previously received and considered
submissions and findings from the special consultative procedure in December
2018, before making its in-principle decision to proceed with further work on
the Initial Public Offering Transaction.
6.      Agrees that the further changes to the 2018-2028 Long Term Plan
(LTP) amendment do not vary materially from the proposed LTP amendment that
accompanied the ‘Our Port – Have Your Say’ consultation document.
7.      Notes that the adoption of the attached amendment to the 2018-2028
Long Term Plan does not constitute a decision to proceed with a minority Initial
Public Offering.
8.      Adopts the attached amendment to the 2018-2028 Long Term Plan as
presented, with any minor editorial corrections as necessary, to explicitly
provide for any final decision to transfer the ownership or control of a
minority stake in Napier Port through the appropriate listing structure.
9.      Instructs staff to publish the amended 2018-2028 Long Term Plan in
its final form.
10.    Instructs staff to advise submitters on the ‘Our Port

assumptions into their asset infrastructure strategies and asset management
plans, and the role of the regional council in advocacy and leadership around
climate change adaptation and mitigation work as has happened with
development of the Coastal Hazards Strategy

Significant HBRC Activities through
April 2019
The item was taken as read, with
questions and discussions traversing:
·
Ahuriri ColiMinder technology for monitoring
real-time water quality, with study under way into whether more timely
results can be made available to the public remotely
·
Resource consent applications for Stormwater
discharges to Ahuriri Estuary are on hold - NCC awaiting tangata whenua
feedback and Landcorp awaiting further information requested
·
Erosion Control Scheme applications from
landowners resulting from some targeted communications but mostly spread
through word of mouth and a potential approach to Council for bringing
forward some of the funding to respond to the level of interest, which has
exceeded expectations
·
the insertion of the sleeve into the pipeline
started Monday and Pan Pac is hoping to be able to confirm that repairs are
complete by the end of this week subject to weather conditions
·
Faecal source tracking for Pandora Pond and
query whether monitoring of inner harbour is possible in conjunction with NCC
and the Port, within the existing work programme and budgets, including a
preliminary assessment for the June Environment and Services Committee
meeting
·
Monitoring network review to be undertaken collaboratively
with all related agencies, to look at the entire monitoring network
