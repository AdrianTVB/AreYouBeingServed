& Recreation
1.1   Purpose
of Report
The purpose of this report is to
fulfil the requirements of the four caveats to the LTP decision to proceed with
the development of the “Pools & Play” option at Prebensen
Drive.
At the Māori Consultative Committee meeting
The Manager Sport and
Recreation, together with the Pou Ārahi/Strategic Māori Advisor,
spoke to the report. They affirmed that the concerns expressed during the
public forum around accessibility and connection to the current site have
been heard. It was confirmed that the Chief Executive is meeting with Pat and
Joseph later in the week and an invitation to attend this meeting was
extended to Tiwana at the meeting.
A brief overview of how Council has arrived at this
point was provided, and it was noted that the decision facing Council now is
to consider the scope of the tender. The aquatic strategy identified that the
facilities provided need to meet the needs of the community now and into the
future. The QEII facility in Christchurch comes very close to meeting those
needs. Through drawing on Christchurch City Council’s experience and
processes, Council is able to significantly reduce the costs and timeframe of
this project. The risks and costs associated with the Onekawa site were also
discussed with the Committee.
With the closure of a number of school pools and now
Pandora Pond for recreational use, Committee members noted the importance of
an accessible aquatic facility for kids. Safety concerns were also raised on
behalf of some residents as a result of moving the facility from neutral
territory.
Although statistics show 92% of users drive to the
current facility, the next step involves investigating the operational
aspects of the facility including accessibility in relation to transport,
programmes and so on. The work that Council officers are undertaking regarding
equitable access to the new facility will be developed with input from
stakeholders.
The Committee were advised that under the terms of
reference of this Committee they are able to make recommendations in this
meeting for consideration by Council.

Section

would be likely unreasonably to prejudice the commercial position of the
person who supplied or who is the subject of the information
Section
7(2)(i) Enable the local authority to carry on, without prejudice or

4.1   Purpose
of Report
The purpose of this report is to
update Council on the current plastic recycling market situation, the impact on
the Napier City Council waste services and the options going forward.
At the Māori Consultative Committee meeting
The Chief Executive spoke to the report, noting that
the recycling environment Is changing rapidly as a result of changes to the
overseas markets.
Council’s current contractor is on a month by
month contract only, which is not ideal considering there are a number of
performance issues as well as significantly increased costs for the service
provided. Experts are advising Council that the cost for recycling services is
likely to be up to $95 per year per household, but this figure will be
unconfirmed until Council goes out to tender.
It was noted that part of the Annual Plan process
involves asking how Council should pay for the increased costs of recycling.
Council also needs to align with the Waste Minimisation Management Plan - Council’s
joint waste strategy with Hastings District Council. One of the key
objectives of the joint strategy is trying to minimise the amount of waste
ending up in the landfill.
The Committee were advised that recycling is likely to
be a recurring item on future agendas.
