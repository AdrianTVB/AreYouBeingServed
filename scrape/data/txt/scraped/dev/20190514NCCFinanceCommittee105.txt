1.1   Purpose
of Report
To report to Council the
financial forecast to the 30 June 2019 for the whole of Council.
At the Meeting
In response to questions from Councillors the
following points were clarified:
·
There are no significant delays to any specific water related
projects as a result of the carry forwards noted in the financial forecast;
however, the work programme over the next few years will need to be
prioritised in terms of resourcing.
·
Only six sections remain unsold from the current stage of
Parklands. It is anticipated that the Plan change will assist Council in
bringing more sections to the market. It was noted that at the time the
current stage at Parklands went to market, sections were also released in Te
Awa and Greenmeadows.
·
The carry forward of the Aquatic budget is a result of the
process that Council has been through over the last six months. The Aquatic
Centre project is not as far along as Council officers had anticipated it
would be at this time.

2.1   Purpose of Report
To present the CCTV and Disposal
of Surplus Assets Policy to Council to be approved.
At the Meeting
It was noted that the CCTV Policy is in relation to
the operation of CCTV cameras and how to access data from them. A street
management plan is being developed which will help Council assess the number
of CCTV cameras that are required and how best to manage privacy issues; at
present there are 12 street-based CCTV cameras which are managed by a Trust.
To increase this number certain criteria need to be met. It was noted that
the Trust is now at capacity and this structure may need to be reassessed
moving forward.
In response to questions from Councillors it was
clarified that the use of drone technology raises significant privacy and
operational issues, and that CCTV technology now has a much broader reach now
in terms of how this can be used.
Committee's recommendation
Councillors
Price / Dallimore
That Council:
a.     Approve
the updates made to the CCTV Policy for finalisation and publication.
b.     Approve
the updates made to the Disposal of Surplus Assets Policy for finalisation
and publication.
Carried
The meeting adjourned at 3.10pm to allow
the Community Service Committee meeting to be held before moving into
Committee, and reconvened at 3.22pm.
