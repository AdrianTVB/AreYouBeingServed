and flowers to acknowledge her 26th anniversary of starting work at
the Council.
Councillors
Wendy Schollum and Eileen Lawson were welcomed as observers at this Youth
Council meeting.
In response to a
query raised, the Youth Development Coordinator, Ang Hughes explained the background and
current situation regarding Youth Grants – there was no longer a budget
for this, as funding was from outside sources.
An alternative
approach was suggested, whereby YC members could promote/spotlight a person or
project and “bio” them on Facebook (without funding from YC)
– this would be further discussed at the 12 June meeting.
The Manager
Social and Youth Development, Dennise Elers, thanked the YC for their help at
the recent Mayors’ Taskforce for Jobs Graduation.
Next Friday, 17
May would be a promotion to stop bullying - YC members were asked to stay after
the meeting for a photo (to be put onto Facebook and Instagram) to promote this
event.  There would be badges, pens and pamphlets to circulate.
Kathleen Steffert, Pelerose Vaima’a, Kate Allen and Eva Harper had asked
for large posters to be delivered to their school (HGHS).

May 2019 Report
(Document 19/468)
Revitalisation of Albert Square
The Hastings
District Youth Council (YC) members had met at Albert
Square at 3.30pm to familiarise themselves with the area prior to the
presentation at today’s meeting.
The Public Spaces Planning Manager,
Rachel Stuart, spoke to the meeting gave a
presentation on the “Hastings City Centre Public Spaces Revitalisation
Plan Feb 2019" (PRJ17-140-0110).  She had addressed the
previous YC meeting on 3 April 2019.  Members had been invited to work
with council officers as part of a working group to develop Albert Square
– they would build on the work that had been started with the 2018
Youth Council.  The aim was to finish the work this calendar year.
Gurjas Sekhon left the meeting at 4.00pm.
The members were asked to email ideas to
Rachel, ideally via a single YC point of contact.  Rachel would
incorporate the ideas into a concept plan and come to each YC meeting to
update the members and discuss suggestions/developments.
Multicultural Strategy Working Group
Community Connector, Junior Tuakana, spoke to the meeting outlining the Multicultural Strategy and
asking for feedback.  This was addressed via a brainstorming event that
was held at the meeting with YC members adding statements/ideas/comments in
relation to four statements displayed on flip charts regarding diversity and
inclusiveness in Hastings.
The YC reconfirmed the names of the three
members put forward at the previous meeting to be involved with the Multicultural Strategy Working Group, as the YC’s representatives - Pelerose
Vaima’a, Ondre Hapuku-Lambert and Boston Wynyard.  An email was forwarded to the Team Leader Community and
Safety, Louise Stettner confirming these appointees (CG-14-33-00134).
Presentation by Local Youth MP
(James Cowan)
Local Youth MP,
James Cameron, addressed the meeting and circulated a sheet containing a
number of Youth Parliament Select Committee topics (CG-14-33-00129).
He advised that the Youth Parliament would be meeting in July.
He asked the YC members for feedback on
the questions set out under three of the topics on the sheet – being Social
Services and Community (the importance of involving young people in
political and practical aspects of citizenship – e.g voting);  Justice
(prevention of youth becoming persistent reoffenders) and Health
(suicide rate).  The members put forward a large number of
suggestions which James recorded.  He thanked the YC for their feedback
and would keep in touch with them.
Hawke’s Bay Health Board –
Hawke’s Bay Health Consumer Council
Ken Foote, Hawke’s Bay District
Health Board had sent a letter (CG-14-33-00128) and covering email (CG-14-33-00127).
The meeting addressed the letter which was seeking a YC member to be
appointed to sit on the Hawke’s Bay Health Consumer Council.
Councillor Dixon was the Co-Deputy Chair of the Council and he briefly spoke
to the letter.
It was agreed that Daisy Hill would
be appointed to the Hawke’s Bay Health Consumer Council, as the Hastings District Youth Council’s representative and
attend the consumer council’s meetings.  Ashleigh
Keenan would be the alternate representative if Daisy was unable to
attend.
As the next meeting of the Consumer
Council was on the following day, 9 May 2019, Ang Hughes would notify Daisy
of the date, time and venue.  Due to the short timeframe involved, Councillor
Dixon would advise the Hawke’s Bay Health Consumer Council of
Daisy’s appointment and give her apologies if she was unable to attend
the 9 May 2019 meeting.
A letter would be emailed to Ken Foote (CG-14-33-00132
and CG-14-33-00133) confirming of the appointment of Daisy Hill and
noting Ashleigh Keenan as the alternate, and giving their respective email
contact details.
International Advisory Group
Councillor Dixon is a member of the International
Advisory Group (IAG) and advised that the Group meet twice a year.  The
object of the Group was to foster relationships with multicultural groups and
form relationships including its Sister City Guilin and visiting
groups.  One of the main purposes was involved with hosting and exchange
of international students.
It was agreed that Charliot Miller would be appointed as the Youth Council representative and attend
the IAG meetings.  An email (CG-14-33-00108) would be forwarded
to the Council’s Economic Development Manager, Mr Lee Neville advising
him of this appointment.
Proposed New Youth Council Logo
At the last meeting on 3 April 2019, the
YC members had been given information about rebranding and preparing a design
brief.  Information forwarded to the Council’s Marketing and Communications Advisor, Gina Armstrong had been compiled.  Concepts to be considered by the YC as
its new logo had been included in the agenda as an attachment to the report
for this item (CG-14-33-00104).
The YC members discussed each of the
three logo alternatives proposed, noting the pros and cons of each
design.  Ang Hughes would relay their comments about each option back to
Gina and ask the latter to further refine the concepts.
Monthly Reports
The YC members read their respective
reports into the record (CG-14-33-00110 and CG-14-33-00111).  These
reports had been sent to Ang Hughes prior to the meeting.  All members
were asked to send these reports in, even if they had nothing to report for
that month.
Youth Week Friday, 17 May to
Sunday, 26 May 2019
This would be promoted on the Facebook
page.  The YC addressed each of the events that would be taking place.
Large A3 copies of the Youth Week
programme details were circulated (CG-14-33-00126) and addressed.
Ang Hughes had already sent copies of the programme to the schools but YC
members felt these had not been displayed or promoted as well as effectively
as possible and so Ang would reprint and deliver more copies to the schools.
Gumboot Hunt – if any of the clues involved in this were posted they
needed to be taken down immediately.
Launch Event – Boston Wynyard and James McPhail were asked to send
details to Charliot Miller, by midday on 9 May, details of the bands taking
part – names, how many in the band, instruments, a contact person,
estimate of how long they may take and some information about the band.  Ang
Hughes will work with Charliot.
YC members were asked to be “waste
warriors” at the events and would be given high-viz vests and event
lanyards with information about the respective events.
Amazing Race – the clues had been created already due to the short
timeframe available and the prize vouchers had been organised.  This
would be advertised on social media,
Cosplay –
a guest artist had been invited to attend,
Basketball Competition – assistance was needed to distribute food to the
participants.  YC members to email Charliot Miller.
