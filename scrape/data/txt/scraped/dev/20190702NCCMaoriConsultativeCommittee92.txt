Announcements by
the Chairperson
The
Chair invited the Team Leader Governance to speak to the committee following
the meeting with the Napier City Council Civic Awards selection panel on 2 July 2019.
The
selection panel recognised that the boundaries of
Ahuriri/ Napier operate differently for pākehā and Māori, and under
the current guidelines of the Civic Awards those who contribute significantly
in a voluntary capacity to our community but reside outside the City boundary
cannot be recognised by the Awards.
The Panel have proposed that the boundary for Māori nominees
or those whose nomination is primarily in relation to contributions to Ahuriri/
Napier Māori be altered to encompass the eight marae affiliated with te
Taiwhenua O Te Whanganui-a-Orotū. They requested feedback from
the Māori Consultative Committee members
regarding the instigation of a more appropriate
citizenship boundary for Māori in relation to these Awards, and whether
the use of the marae of te Taiwhenua O Te Whanganui-a-Orotū was an appropriate approach. It was confirmed that the City boundary would remain
for pākehā nominees and where the voluntary
work has not been specific to mana/ tāngata whenua.
Committee
members confirmed their approval of the proposed boundary extension for
Māori nominees and discussed other ways in which Council could encourage
participation by Māori in the nomination process.
Announcements by
the management
The Chief Executive congratulated committee member Tiwana
Aranui on his recent Queen’s Birthday Honour recognition, on behalf of
Council.

Policy Planning
1.1   Purpose
of Report
The purpose of this report is to
follow up on recent seminars held with Council on 3 April and 2 May 2019
regarding the review of the District Plan and for Council to approve ‘in
principle’ the preferred policy direction for specific workstreams so that
officers can draft chapters of the District Plan within an agreed
framework/strategic direction.
At the Māori Consultative Committee meeting
In response to
questions from Councillors, the following points were clarified:
·
This report seeks approval for the agreed policy framework that
will set the direction for specific workstreams in the review of the District
Plan; the potential boundary adjustment is a separate project which is only
in the very early stages.
·
Although Mana Ahuriri Trust are not referenced specifically in
the policy framework, Council will be required to effectively engage with Mana
Ahuriri Trust and other entities throughout the District Plan Review process.
Engagement with effected parties will be undertaken within the project framework,
which sits below the workstreams being considered at this point.
·
It was noted that the District Plan is not developed based on
economic factors.
·
Engagement with Mana Ahuriri Trust and te
Taiwhenua O Te Whanganui-a-Orotū will be important throughout the process to
mitigate the potential risk of litigation.
The Chief Executive agreed that it would be useful for
Council planners to meet with the committee, and explain how the District
Plan Review process will evolve over the next year or so.
