Annual Plan Submissions 2019/20
(Document 19/440)
The Strategy Manager, Mr Verhoeven advised
that the purpose of the report was to inform the
Rural Community Board about submissions received to the 2019-2020 Annual Plan
pertaining to rural issues, and to obtain feedback from the Board for the
Council meeting dated 4 June 2018.  Officer comments on the submissions
had been included in the Agenda report.
HEARING OF VERBAL SUBMISSIONS
Submission No. 16  - Tony Lane and Luke Shadbolt spoke to their submission requesting funding to carry out
essential maintenance work on the hall including electrical work, hot water
supply, chairs, kitchen floor, ovens, fridge, dishwasher and kitchen benches.
Mr Lane circulated a revised list of hall maintenance issues
(CG-14-26-00113) and advised that the Hall Committee would take a long term
view of maintenance and seek external funding sponsorship, fundraising with
community and partnership with Council.
Mr Shadbolt advised that the Hall Committee required confirmation
of ownership of the hall as it was a community asset but Council owned the
land.  The Eastern and Central Community Trust required confirmation of
who was responsible for the Hall as funding would not be provided if it was Council
owned and operated.
It was noted that the correct legal name for the Hall was
Waimarama/Maraetotara Memorial Hall.  Officers would check earthquake
status of the building and advise the Hall Committee.
The
Hastings District Rural Community Board
supported the officer’s comments that the request for multiple actions
totalling approximately $100,000 with local community support totalling approximately
$15,000.  These works may be able to be reasonably carried out over
three to four years.
The
Hastings District Rural Community Board
supported earmarking of $10,000 from the existing Parks New Works Budget to
assist the hall committee in undertaking priority 1 tasks in 2019/20, as part
of an overall staged funding plan because
acknowledge it was for critical safety.
Submission Nos. 18 and 20 – Kiri Goodspeed spoke to her submissions regarding the:
·
Development of a Community Plan for Te Pohue,
Te Harato and Tarawera within the Mohaka Ward; and
·
Indiscriminate littering, freedom camping at
the Waimarama Reserve and visitors “fence hopping” to dump
rubbish on the Waipuka2E Māori Reservation; and
The
Hastings District Rural Community Board supported the installation of a double litter bin which allowed for general
litter and recyclables, with the initial cost to supply and install the
double bin being funded from the Waimarama Reserves Management Plan LTP
allocation.
The annual
cost of servicing the bins was $950.00 per annum and funding be allocated in
the maintenance budgets for the 19/20 Annual Plan and in subsequent
years.
The Hastings District Rural Community
Board supported the development of a Te Pohue
Community Plan, which could be accommodated within the budget and work plan
for 2019/20.
Submission No. 22 – Vicki Butterworth on behalf of
Hawke’s Bay Trails displayed a powerpoint presentation (CG-14-26-00110) outlining a
proposal and funding request for $100,000 toward the Bayview
to Whirinaki Cycleway extension of Hawke’s Bay Trails, as approved by
New Zealand Cycle Trail.  This was for a 7.5km shared coastal trail,
including a dedicated swing bridge for cycling and walking.
The Hastings District Rural Community
Board supported officers comments  that this
would be a popular addition to the Hawke’s Bay trails and complete an
iconic off-road route from Whirinaki all the way to Clifton, connecting
communities as it does so.  It would also link a major employer and a
large recreational facility with the urban areas of Hawke’s Bay.
The project
utilised a mix of local roadsides, state highway, railway land and
beachfront. It spanned both Napier and Hastings and would create a new
walking and cycling bridge between the two.  50% of funding had been
approved by MBIE with roughly 10% being requested from each of the three
councils and 20% from Pan Pac.  The project would not be currently
funded in the Long Term Plan.
Submission No. 30 – John Roil spoke to his submission and questioned the use of consultants and
post evaluation of work.  Handling of consents was set by local
authorities and with compliance and inefficiencies it created additional
costs to the applicant.  Mr Roil felt that there appeared to be no encouragement
to increase the level of service and with the lack of post evaluation
reporting the same inefficiencies continued to occur.
Mr Roil recommended that the
Hastings District Council set up a process where a Post Evaluation Report
(PER) was required
on all projects undertaken through the Resource
Management Act process and that the report
should be chaired by an independent person, who was recognised to be impartial with the aim to improve the service based on Better
Practice rather Best
Practice that may be influenced by Risk Aversion, rather than risk management .
Mr Roil
advised that the department needed
to have enough authority to facilitate any changes required to improve the service provided. He hoped
that Council saw this as an opportunity rather than a Risk to their authority.
The Hastings District Rural Community
Board supported officer comments and endorsed continuous improvements; and that
Council management does support its staff to
make the appropriate judgements on both building consents and resource
consent applications.
This concluded the verbal presentations.
______________________
The meeting adjourned for afternoon tea at 3.10pm
and reconvened at 3.30pm.

then addressed.

Submission No. 25 - Dan Bergoff-Howes Esk River Care Group submitted a
request to assist in forming a Trust for the Esk River Care Group to hold
monies and to create the legal structure to enter a long term agreement with
the Department of Conservation to replant and manage a strip of land along
the Esk River.
The
Hastings District Rural Community Board supported the officers comments and
suggested an allocation of $10,000 seed funding be considered by
Council.  This could be used to set up their trust structure, undertake
survey work in partnership with adjoining land owners or to initially
undertake an approved planting plan on Council or public reserves.
The Board
suggested that after the trieniuum elections a subcommittee of Councillors be
formed  to understand what was being done in the biodiversity space.

Farmers submitted the following points:

·

Area and by land use.
·
That the General

Review Working Party.  The appropriate level of uniform charging moving
