To consider the Quarterly Report

At the meeting
In response to questions from

The new water treatment plant is required to bring multiple
treatment facilities into a single permanent location.
·
District licensing hearings occur when one of the parties (i.e.
the Police or the District Health Board) object to an application. An
unprecedented number of hearings have been required recently. It was noted
that licensing inspections undertaken by the Police are typically for high
risk premises only.
·
NPS housing referred to under the Senior Strategy section is in
reference to the National Policy Statement which is concerned with growth and
providing for growth.
·
Performance reporting from the contractor responsible for
responding to noise control complaints outlined that a 25 minute response
time was not always achievable.

The aims and outcomes set out under Democracy and Governance
will be reassessed by the new Council.
·
Council officers advised that they will come back to
Councillors with further information regarding the delays around stormwater
modelling.
·
It was noted that Council officers were unaware of stormwater
impacts on eels raised by Councillor Tapine and requested that he provide
further data to assist officers in addressing these concerns.
A number of Councillors
acknowledged Council officers’ quick response rate to recent roading
and footpath issues and continued work in relation to water clarity
complaints.
