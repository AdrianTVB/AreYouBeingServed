Verbal Updates by Advisory
Representatives
Paul Michaelson (AA)
·
Noted the lack of capacity in Police and
asking support for our colleagues as they cannot patrol everywhere,
especially on intersections when drivers are jumping red lights.
·
Considerable increase in mobile use.
·
many drivers with bad habits (passing on
blind heights and corners, speeding, jumping red lights)
·
AA will investigate possible solutions and
cost to install cameras at traffic lights and intersections
Matt Broderick
( NZ Police)
·
The most cost effective way to control this
issue , is to install cameras at traffic light systems.
·
Monitoring and administration of these camera
systems could be very high.
·
NZ Police do not have the capacity on national
level to manage and administer these systems and  they would have to be
locally owned and managed.
·
Cell phone use is a more serious issue in
Hawke’s Bay than red ight running .
Brian Gregory
·
Looking forward to the completion of the cycle
way extension.
·
Proposed that streetlamps at weigh station be
moved down to the right hand turn into Tapairu Road, further south.
Andrew
Palairet (Port of Napier)

Nothing to report on coastal shipping,
remains non-viable but  will continue to look for opportunities.

Napier Port appreciates their involvement in
this committee.

Forestry volumes continues to increase –
approximately 20% increase in log export volumes this year.

Working collaboratively with Dean Prebble,

objectives in the supply chain from forest to port.  A small workshop
with a number of stakeholders has been held to discuss the various congestion
points and volumes of log trucks particularly around Severn street.
·
Container volumes also increased
slightly.
·
The B-Double project (The project to reduce
the number of trucks that have to travel to the empty container depot by

Meeting with

Cr
Fenton Wilson
Driver
licensing:
Raised
at the last meeting and requested an update.  Anne Redgrave reported
that the Driver Licensing Group has met to discuss funding for next
year.  No funding available at present through NZTA programme or the
local share.  Would need to go back to councils to apply for funding
to continue work.  Decision from the group  was to ask each provider
to assess the ongoing demand and what a cessation for the HBRC funding
would mean for its clients, before meeting again to make a final
decision.    Anne Redgrave to report back to the committee
on the outcome of this.
Matt
Broderick responded that he obtained data from NZTA in relation to pass
rates and whether the money invested has had any impact on drivers with
restricted licences.  It appears that Hawke’s Bay had performed
well  on this recently.
Cr
David Tennent
Speed
restrictions at the various roadworks especially south of Napier:
Questions
arose as to whether there is any responsibility on contractors to adjust
speed limit when no work is done.
Emma
Speight replied that NZTA is experiencing many challenges during road
works. Getting the right speed matters.  NZTA is educating drivers to
pay attention to road works and to reduce speed.  Working with
contractors to adjust speed indications while working or not. Remains
challenging.
