Māori Consultative Committee - 26
February 2019 - Open Minutes
General
business
The following matters were
raised and discussed during a round table discussion at the request of the
Chair.
Matariki Regional Economic Development Strategy
(Matariki REDS)
The Committee requested an overview of Matariki REDS. The
Chief Executive confirmed that he would provide an presentation/update to the Committee
at the next Māori Consultative Committee meeting.
Appointments to the Māori Consultative
Committee
Clarification was requested as
to how members are appointed to this Committee due to concerns being raised
amongst other groups around the current representation.
It was clarified that although
members are appointed by the Mayor, this has been done in consultation with
Piri. A conscious decision was made to not appoint representatives of different
parts of Māoridom but rather to have good people from within the Māori
community around the table.
The Strategic Māori
Advisor noted that Council as a whole is going through an evolutionary process
in relation to cultural competency. He advised that Council want better
representation and to be more responsive to mana whenua but needs their
involvement to achieve this, and although Council has made some big
improvements in this space over the last two years there is still a lot of work
to do.
It was noted that Local
Government across New Zealand is experiencing issues with Māori
engagement. Napier City Council has large cultural aspirations but recognises
that these will only be achieved through working together.
The Committee agreed that
appointments to the Māori Consultative Committee were best to be discussed
and agreed upon by the current committee members with recommendations to be put
forward to the Mayor. The Strategic Māori Advisor confirmed that he would
assist in facilitating this.
Terms of Reference
It was noted that the new Terms
of Reference are yet to be confirmed and an update was requested from officers.
The Strategic Māori Advisor confirmed that he will provide an update on
the Terms of Reference at the next meeting.
Art Deco Weekend
The 2019 Art Deco Weekend was
discussed with the lack of Māori involvement noted by the Committee;
however, the Māori section of the fashion parade and the pōwhiri were
both highlighted as successes. Officers noted that the Art Deco Trust are
currently reviewing their capacity etc. and Council may be in a position to
assist the Trust with their cultural responsiveness.
Other
·
The Strategic Māori Advisor noted that the ASB Building is
now under new ownership with the owners looking to restore the Māori
motifs featured in the building.
·
It was noted that the NZ Planning Institute Conference will be
held here in Napier this year and the Committee members were asked to advise
the Strategic Māori Advisor if they wish to attend. A Māori focus day
will be held on 2 April 2019 specifically for kaupapa Māori in the
planning space.
·
In response to comments from the Committee as to whether Napier
holds any records around how marae and hapū groups assisted at the time of
the earthquake, the Strategic Māori Advisor noted that he had recently
attended a hui on marae resilience. He relayed how the Parewahawaha Marae in
Bulls had captured their own korero on what they had done in the past,
including where they lived and why they lived there.
Tiwana
Aranui closed the proceedings with a karakia at 4.12pm.
