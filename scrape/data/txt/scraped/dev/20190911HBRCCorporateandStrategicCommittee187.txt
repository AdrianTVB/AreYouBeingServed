Report and Recommendations from the
Finance Audit and Risk Sub-committee
Jessica Ellerm introduced the item, highlighting the two
significant issues of the Remission of Penalties on Rates Policy (Fixed Term)
and the Six Monthly Report on Risk Assessment and Management the meeting
considered.
·
Due to Council’s change in the rates
payment due date from 31 January 2021 to 20 September 2020, some
ratepayers will be required to make two payments in the 2020 calendar year,
therefore the Remission of Penalties on Rates Policy (Fixed Term) is intended
to assist ratepayers who may experience financial hardship as a result
·
Recommendations for adjustments to the SIPO
and Council’s investment portfolio, including the proceeds of the Port
share float will be put to the new Council for consideration and
communication with the public.
·
An item on several matters arising from the
Port IPO will be presented to the 25 September Council meeting
·
It was suggested that the HAIL register and
Council’s Procurement policies be shared with Toro Waaka, and that the
draft Remission of Penalties on Rates Policy (Fixed Term) be attached with
the recommendations from this committee.

Annual Report Update
Jessica Ellerm introduced the item and discussions traversed:
·
Financials from Napier Port were received late
due to the Napier Port IPO transaction, thus the delay in timing to present
the financials
·
The Group Financial statements will be
consolidated this week and its intended that the final Annual Report will be
presented to an Extraordinary Meeting of Council on 9 October 2019.
Steven Lucy, Council’s
auditor, advised:
·
Napier Port is also experiencing delays in
terms of the Regional Council’s reporting
·
Due to the Port being listed on the stock
market, the ability to share financial information became more limited
·
Discussions between HBRC management, HBRIC and
Napier Port decided what information can be released and made available;
being Napier Port financial position at the end of March 2019, and HBRIC and
HBRC to 30 June 2019
·
It would be prudent for both HBRIC and HBRC to
obtain legal and accounting advice on non-compliance with accounting
standards.
Desiree Cull introduced
the non-financial measures and discussions covered:
·
The new (2018-28 LTP) measures focus on
quantitative results that can be verified and repeated, to build a time
series to show trends over time
·
60 measures in total and 77 % of those were
either achieved or partially achieved and 3 not measured
·
Previous reporting was activity based, however
the Local Government Act requires Council to now describe the community
outcomes and to link the activities to the outcomes
·
Council consciously decided that they wanted
to see stretchy objectives and thus not surprising to see some
“non-achievement” on these measures.
·
Objectives are measured over both the 3year and
10 year period in the Long Term Plan.
·    HBRC will proactively work with territorial authorities to achieve
alignment on policies, plans and strategies – this particular measure needs
to be prioritised and reviewed in the next Long Term Plan.
·
It was suggested that Tāngata Whenua Partnerships and Community Engagement Activity has not been
achieved in terms of tikanga
·
In addition to the non financial measures
reporting, there is an extensive narrative in the Annual Report regarding the
Regional Planning Committee, the Māori Committee, the Operation of the Māori Partnerships group and a range of bilateral partnerships that
HBRC has with tangata whenua
·
It was suggested that Catchment Management
Activities should include partnerships with TLAs in the next LTP
·
Concerns raised about the Compliance and
Pollution Response Activity being “not Achieved” with 90.9% of
resource consents monitored due to resourcing issues
·
Concerns raised that Council is losing sight
of the Civil Defence component of the business with increased focus on
Community Engagement capability and Hazards Management.
C&S14/19
Resolution
That the Corporate and
Strategic Committee receives the “Annual
Report Update” staff report.
