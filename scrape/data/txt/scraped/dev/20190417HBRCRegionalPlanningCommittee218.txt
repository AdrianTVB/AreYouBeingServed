meeting resolved that no further expenditure would be made with respect to
investigating or progressing any amendment to PC6 unless/until authorised by

the Central Hawke’s Bay District Council survey of households in Ongaonga

identified to find solutions.  Liz Lambert also noted that the affected

scheme.

Overview of the Regional Three Waters
Review
·
In response to a request for an update on the
Three Waters Review workshop held with tangata whenua in March, it was noted
that it was a successful workshop  facilitated by Toni Goodlass (Napier
City Council) and Troy Brockbank (WSP Opus). Tangata whenua were given the opportunity to raise their
concerns and issues and assist in developing options and recommendations to
improve the management of drinking water, stormwater and wastewater services.
·
It was noted that the Three Waters Review does
not deal with RMA issues but is about processes and how service delivery will
be managed by territorial authorities in the long term.
·
Staff working on the review are requested to
provide a report to tangata whenua around the engagement plan, specifically
in relation to Māori
cultural values
·
In response to a query, the committee was
advised that the review is about infrastructure and service delivery and not
mana of the wai, where it sits and who it belongs to
·
The regional review findings will feed into
the National review process currently under way.
