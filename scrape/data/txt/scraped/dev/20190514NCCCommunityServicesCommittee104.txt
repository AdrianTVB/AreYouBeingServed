Agenda
Items
1.    Iron
Maori Event - Hardinge Road and Marine Parade Proposed Road Closures
Type of Report:
Operational
Legal Reference:
N/A
Document ID:
730705
Reporting Officer/s &
Unit:
Sera Chambers, Transportation
Team Administrator
Kevin Murphy, Event Manager
1.1   Purpose
of Report
To seek approval for the proposed
course change and proposed road closures for the Iron Māori event to be
held in 2019 and future years.
At the Meeting
The Team Leader Transportation spoke to the report and
noted that the Iron Māori event organisers have raised the proposed
changes with Council early to be able to communicate how they are managing
the risk of Pandora Pond with their athletes as soon as possible. This report
is required to gauge Council’s comfort level with the proposed road
closures prior to going out for consultation, which may result in further
fine tuning of the event in certain areas.
It was clarified that that closure along Marine Parade
is incorrectly shown on the map provided as the closure will only apply to
the seaward side of the road.
In response to questions from Councillors the
following points were clarified:
·
Consultation will be undertaken with businesses and residents
in relation to the proposed road closures. Access restrictions during the
road closures will form part of the consultation.
·
The whole course is changing from previous years. The safest
place for the athletes to complete the swim leg is along Hardinge Road; the
exit and cycle route down Marine Parade is less problematic than the second
option of Bridge Street out to Prebensen Drive.
·
The proposed road closures are the same as those for the
Harbour to Hills Triathlon and will also apply to the other events mentioned
in the report.
·
The length and duration of the road closures for the childrens’
events will be shorter.
