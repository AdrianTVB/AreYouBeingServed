HB Knowledge Bank
·      HB Knowledge Bank has been running for eight years and is made up
of 80-100 volunteers.
·      The website was relaunched this year with the initial quote being
$35,000 for this work, but was achieved for $12,500.
·      The Knowledge Bank was profiled in this month’s Bay Buzz
magazine noting the broad section of challenges and issues they face.
·      They are asking for Council’s continued support. The labour
is free; however, as the number of volunteers grows more equipment is
required.
·
Volunteers are currently researching the history
of scouting in the area.
In response to
questions from Councillors it was confirmed that other Councils have been
approached also and Hastings District Council has committed funding for three
years for equipment and projects.
Charles Daugherty
Biodiversity Hawke’s Bay
·      Biodiversity Hawke’s Bay was founded on the view that
biodiversity restoration will make a difference to the people in this region;
it is a community based initiative.
·      The action plan was launched 18 months ago.
·      There are two operational streams being the Biodiversity Guardians
and the Biodiversity Foundation.
·      All five Hawke’s Bay Councils are involved as accountable
partners.
·      The Foundation’s primary focus is to create an endowment
fund ($10Million in 10 years) with the proceeds being used to grow the fund, and
in perpetuity to support projects being undertaken by others around the
region. A small grants/projects fund is already operational.
·      Partnerships are also a focus, as the aim of Biodiversity
Hawke’s Bay is to support others with their projects, rather than to
lead them. Partnerships of note are with Great Things Grow Here and the
Hawke’s Bay Airport (a platinum sponsor). It was noted that
Biodiversity Hawke’s Bay may be able to apply for funding for Council
projects.
·      Biodiversity Hawke’s Bay is seeking support from all five
Councils by way of contribution to the endowment fund, contribution to
operating costs and through active partnerships.
·
Various large projects were talked through for
which funding is being sought.
In response to
questions from Councillors it was noted that of the $50,000 provided by
Council last year, $25,000 was directed to the endowment fund with the
remainder going towards staffing and projects.
It was also
noted that there is no particular organisational model to follow in this area
but central government has confirmed that it needs to be done.
Mark Aspden and Sam Weir
Sport HB
·      An overview was provided for what has been achieved to date in the
Maraenui and Tamatea communities following last year’s approved
funding.
·      Sport HB noted the work that Council is doing in the wellbeing
space with development of the destination playground, sporting facilities and
new swimming pool.
·      An overview was provided for what has been achieved to date in the
Maraenui and Tamatea communities following last year’s approved funding..
·      Sam Weir, Community Activator, spoke to projects in Maraenui
including ‘a better life through movement’ and whakakohe kura.
·
Sport HB feel that they have “only just
scratched the surface” in the last 12 months and are seeking further
support from Council to continue this work.
In response to questions from Councillors
the following points were clarified:
·      In relation to funding for facilities and programmes and meeting
the same outcomes in two different markets (Napier and Hastings),they believe
as long as everyone is clear about who is doing what this can be managed with
minimal conflict. Sport HB do not run any facility in the region so there is
no overlap there.
·      The focus needs to be on home life and not just activity focused.
Sport NZ is clear that the biggest barrier is deprivation.
·      Sport HB have started waka ama with Tamatea Intermediate in terms
one and four. The main focus has been on Maraenui at this time though, as it
would be difficult to start on both areas at once.
·      Sport HB are currently working with EIT to see how they can
evaluate their progress.
·      Sport HB approach the schools and it is up to the school whether
they choose to take up the opportunity or not.
·
Sport NZ’s strategic plan focuses on
5-18 year olds and decile 1-4 schools. Sport HB also takes the lead from the DHB
and Councils regarding specific areas of focus.
Deborah Burnside
Jervoistown Residents
·      Spoke on behalf of residents in relation to security and roadside
dumping issues in the Jervoistown area.
·      Some residents would like to see better street lighting and
cameras installed. It was noted that some residents may be prepared to
contribute to the cost of this in some way, if necessary.
·      Following requests for data which is not currently tracked,
residents are asking Council to investigate the cost to Council for
collecting dumped rubbish in this area and to find a way to prosecute those
responsible.
·
It was suggested that cameras be installed at
the entry/exit points to capture number plates etc.
In response to questions from Councillors
the following points were clarified:
·      It was noted that properties in this area are rated as rural
properties and therefore do not receive the same level of service as
residential properties.
·      There is currently no signage in the area to deter dumping.
·
Six or seven cameras might be required to
cover the entry/exit points, including Napier Street, Jervois Road and the
tunnel end.

2.1   Purpose
of Report
To present the submissions
received on the Annual Plan 2019/20 Consultation Document for Council’s
consideration.
At the
meeting
The Chair
elected to take the officer’s recommendation in Parts. The following
points were discussed during deliberations:
Part A
i.      Waste
Management:
·
It was suggested that Council would be doing a disservice to
ratepayers by hiding the true cost and paying for this service from reserves.
·
It is expected that there will be a robust debate around
recommendations for receptacles.
·
The community are clearly concerned about environmental
options.
ii.     Disaster
Relief Trust:
·
It was noted that as we live in an area that is susceptible to
large disaster events, it is sensible to have this in place before an
emergency occurs.
iii.    Whakarire
Targeted Rate:
·
The Director Infrastructure Services spoke to the report and
noted that the officer’s recommendation is to delay any decision on the
matter of the targeted rate to allow Council officers an opportunity to
address issues raised by residents, and work through their perceived
cost-benefit concerns.
·
Around 12 properties are directly affected and 96% of residents
disagree with the revetment.
·
The proposed delay is not connected to the decision on coastal
hazards funding as every cell has their own risks to consider; this is a
separate issue.
·
It was noted that a number of residents have concerns around
security and cost, and others are uninformed as they have not taken part in
engagement opportunities to date. Further discussion with the affected
residents is required to ensure they fully understand the project before this
can be progressed further.
·
These properties are at severe risk should another extreme
weather event occur. Some residents claim that they have not suffered damage
to their property to date but it is considered that those residents may not
have experienced a significant event (such as that of the 1970s).
·
Council has an obligation to protect both public and private
properties; to protect the whole Westshore shingle spit is a priority.
·
Residents are confused by the proposed targeted rate as they
had previously been advised that funding was allocated through the endowment
fund.
·
There is no greater risk to the delay than has been the case
for some time already.
·
There was some concern that Council could be seen to be
‘double dipping’ through the targeted rate as well as increased
rates if the property values increase as a result of the revetment. Council
officers noted that all such considerations for public/private funding splits
will have taken into account in s101(3) of the Local Government Act 2002
(LGA). This is not just about cost, but rather how the revetment interacts
with their properties.
·
It was confirmed that should a common understanding be reached
with residents within the 12 months then the project can be progressed at
that time.
The meeting adjourned for
morning tea at 10.07am and reconvened at 10.34am.
iv.    Water
projects:
·
It was noted that this decision is about bringing $7.8Million
of water related projects forward. 193 submissions were received on this
topic, with 168 comments.
·
An amended motion was proposed adding the following to the
Officer’s recommendation:
3.    Confirms
that Water is Councils number 1 priority.
4.    That
council commission an independent options and costings assessment report for
the supply of un-chlorinated water for Napier.
5.    Council
seek expressions of interest for the preparation of this report, and that the
selection of the consultant be done by full Council.
6.    That
$200k be allocated for this review, with this to be funded through loans.
Council note that this will add 0.02% to rates for 2020/21.
7.
That an invitation be extended to CCC Water Supply
Improvement Manager and Canterbury Medical Officer of Health to visit Napier
to share their information and experience with the removal of chlorine from
their network with NCC councillors and staff.
8.
That Council approve those funds be transferred to
Council’s property assessment and compliance projects for 2019/20
($860k).
·
A number of Councillors reiterated that chlorination was forced
on Council following the Havelock North Water Inquiry.
·
Council should consider their options in case central government
leaves the door open to an unchlorinated supply. Some Councillors noted they
would be comfortable spending money to investigate other options considering
the community feedback on this matter. The options and costings should then
form part of a consultation process to allow the community to decide whether
it is unaffordable or not.
·
It is important to state that water is Council’s number
one priority.
·
It was acknowledged that selecting the consultant for the
independent report may need to be undertaken in a public excluded meeting for
commercial reasons.
·
The community are asking Council to investigate other options
and Council need to show that they are listening.
·
Christchurch City Council (CCC) is on track to remove chlorine
by 98% from their network by the end of June.
·
CT or “Contact time” is the concentration of
chlorine x the time required to sit in the holding taken before being
released into the network. This is how Council ensures that any bugs in the
network might be addressed by chlorine. Currently Council is unable to
achieve the required 30 minutes contact time from every dosing point which is
why the two new treatment plants are required.
·
It is correct that chlorine doesn’t address protozoa risk
which is why secure bore status is held and water age actively tracked.
·
Council officers are already in contact with their counterparts
at CCC. For CCC to follow the Netherlands model it would cost a significant
amount to achieve. Council has different views on risk to CCC and although
there are key learnings to be taken from them, Council would prefer the Dutch
were involved in considering options for an un-chlorinated water supply for
Napier as they are the experts in this field.
·
It was noted that the Ministry of Health (MoH) have been
impressed with Council’s work in this space to date and will address
Council later this month. CCC are focussed on getting back to secure bore
status, not on the risks within their network. It is understood MoH are
advising CCC on what needs to be put in place if they move towards a chlorine
free network.
·
Some Councillors felt that the community has been left behind
and these discussions need to be held with the community as well.
The meeting adjourned briefly
at 10.56am and reconvened at 11.02am.
·
A Councillor questioned whether $30Million over 10 years
indicates that water is the number one priority for Council. Council needs to
invest in the network.
·
It was clarified that the network is not ‘wasting
away’. Staff are adhering to a new regulatory scheme. They are
essentially trying to force our network to meet a different set of standards
to what it was built to.
·
Although it would be a greater piece of work if the independent
report could be completed from a regional perspective, the costs would likely
be prohibitive. Council has also been advised that Hastings District Council
do not intend to move to an un-chlorinated water supply.
·
It was asked that the independent report also take into
consideration the negative affects chlorine has had on residents.
In response to questions around
funding the independent report the Chief Executive advised that this report
will require significant Council resources. It was recommended that an
estimated figure of $200,000 be loan funded to cover the cost.
v.     Provincial
Growth Fund:
·
Although the Westshore and Regional Park project applications
will be withdrawn from the Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) the funding that was
allocated for these projects in the Long Term Plan (LTP) will remain but are
based on a different level of outcomes.
·
It was noted that a number of Council’s applications were
made in partnership with community groups i.e. Mana Ahuriri were the lead on
the Regional Park project and Activate Maraenui was made in partnership with
a number of agencies.
·
Although the PGF is a three year fund there are a number of
commitments against it. Council would be best to focus on the applications
already submitted at this time.
Parts B - E
·
Enviroschools is set down for year two. These funds are
committed for now through the LTP but in future they will be directed to
apply through other funds.
·
There were several submissions to the LTP for funding last year
for which the projects fund was used at that time. However this means these
funding allocations fall outside of the grants process; Council officers will
look at the most appropriate fund moving forward as this makes grants
management difficult.
·
Subject to a carry forward being approved by Council, some
funding could be allocated for other applications pending the rollover of the
new financial year, specifically for Basketball Hawke’s Bay and
Creative Arts Napier. These have not been assessed yet and will come to
Council on a case by case basis.
·
The Jervoistown Residents application did not specify an
amount. To buy seven cameras would cost around $21,000, not including
installation or management. This is not something Council has funded in the
past and could be proposed as a community development project through another
grant.
·
Council are currently undertaking a street management review,
including consideration of CCTV run by Council and the Napier Safety trust in
the various business districts. If Council is going to facilitate CCTV in rural
residential areas then this should be part of the wider picture.
·
The Sport HB application for $20,000 could also be applied for
through the community developments fund, although the administrative element
would be ineligible.
·
The Biodiversity HB Foundation application would be ineligible
under the Council Projects fund and the Small Projects fund due to the
endowment fund aspect; Council does not fund the building of other
organisations funds. They would be better to seek funding for a specific
project. They were funded through the Council Projects Fund last year but
that was for seed funding.
·
HB Knowledge Bank could apply to the community development fund
although this has a maximum individual grant amount. Council officers will
liaise with them to assess what funds could be available to them.
·
It was noted that the money set aside for the Pirimai
Residents’ Association under the LTP was for optimising the reserve
component of the land.
·
Council officers confirmed that those funded through the LTP
were advised that it would be a one-off grant. A review of all community
development funding is to be undertaken to assess how effective it is and how
it could be better distributed.
·
Potential duplication and other factors are considered when
funding applications are assessed.
·
It was confirmed that Sport HB have a three year service
agreement with Council and every three years they can propose different
activities and deliverables to be assessed against the agreed outcomes.
·
Information around funding application criteria is available on
the Council website. Council officers will provide a summary to Councillors.
·
It was noted that it might be helpful for staff responses
regarding the location of the library to provide a timeframe for
consultation.
·
In relation to comments on essential services, a comment should
be included to note that water has been made the number one priority.
·
Feedback was provided on behalf of Greypower members that they
would have liked a freepost form included in the consultation document.
·
It was also noted that the community services grant allocation
has increased from $1.60 to $1.80 this year.
·
Council officers were reminded that the community meetings were
a trial this year and Council may elect to go back to formal hearings next
year.

1.1   Purpose
of Report
To present to Council submissions
received on proposed amendments to funding policies and changes to fees and
charges for consideration.
At the
meeting
The Chair
elected to take the officer’s recommendation in Parts. The following
points were raised during deliberations:
Part
A
·
Council officers confirmed that they are already engaging with
Whakarire Avenue residents regarding the revetment and there will be a follow
up meeting with them. The project could progress in the 2019/20 financial
year provided a resolution can be reached with residents.
·
Some residents feel that they are losing their front lawn;
officers note that this is reserve land. It was noted that a concrete path
would be more suitable than limestone or a boardwalk as it is more durable in
the environment; without significant ongoing maintenance, wooden boardwalks
can be noisy and also become quite slippery. Officers confirmed that the path
will be closer to the revetment than the private property boundaries.
·
The culvert will remain where it at as Council is looking to
use that as an option to drain stormwater away from properties. This may need
to be bridged to continue the pathway further away from properties.
·
Council officers noted that they have engaged with the
Whakarire Avenue residents at every critical point in the process and as
Council has been looking to move into each new project phase. The latest
phase of consultation was targeted to affected residents and only two were
unable to attend the meeting. Following the meeting a letter outlining
discussion points and next steps was sent. The residents also had the
opportunity to make submissions through the Annual Plan process, and many of
them have.
·
It was clarified that the loan for the Whakarire Revetment is
through the Harbour Endowment Fund and will not impact ratepayers.
·
The Harbour Endowment Fund cannot meet all the works committed
against it over the next 10 years.
Part
B
·
It was noted that low income earners can apply for a rates rebate
and this now includes retirement village home owners; however, most married
couples do not qualify for this rebate as their household income is too high.
Part C

A number of Councillors enquired whether the members’
entry fee to BaySkate could be reduced from $4 to $2, as it is currently more
expensive for kids that are regular users to go to BaySkate than to hold an
adult golf club membership. It was felt that kids are being priced out of the
facility.
The Chief
Executive advised that this could be possible but Council may need to
increase the membership fee to be able to lower the visit fee.
·
The Manager Sport and Recreation confirmed that membership
retention is quite high for BaySkate with around 360 at present and a number
of very regular users. A revenue review including benchmarking has been
undertaken for the facility and our fees are in line or lower than other
facilities. He noted that if the facility follows a sustainable cost recovery
model this will allow them to be more targeted with specific communities of
interest i.e. providing programmes etc.
One Councillor
noted that they were hesitant to agree to any changes in fees and costs
purely to meet the 40-45% revenue return for facilities under the Revenue and
Financing Policy. The Chief Executive advised that the Revenue and Financing
Policy adopted by Council identifies the public/private split across all
facilities and budgets are then set to meet those splits. It was suggested
that the fees for BaySkate could be left as is at this point allowing
officers to undertake an assessment of different ways the revenue could be
achieved.
·
It was noted that the current operating system at BaySkate
needs to be replaced to better track regular users and that the fees can be
reset at any time during the year.
·
The charge for “live-aboards” at East Pier was
queried as being too low at $18 per night. People are making an economic
choice to live aboard and this is having an impact on sanitation facilities
etc. in the area. The Chief Executive confirmed that this will be looked at
as part of the larger inner harbour project.
