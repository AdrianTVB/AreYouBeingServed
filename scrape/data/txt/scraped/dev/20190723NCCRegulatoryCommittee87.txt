1.    Adoption
of the Draft Stormwater Bylaw 2019 for Public Consultation

1.1   Purpose
of Report
To seek Council approval of the
draft Napier City Council Stormwater Bylaw 2019, the accompanying Statement of
Proposal and to authorise officers to commence the special consultative
procedure for adopting the bylaw.
At the Meeting
The Manager Environmental Solutions spoke to the
report, noting that the proposed Bylaw addresses limitations in the current 2012
version. Previously Council was only empowered to act against high risk
industries, but industries classed as medium or low risk can have unexpected
issues, and without proper planning there could be contaminants from these
sites going into the stormwater network.
It was noted that Bylaws can be difficult to enforce. Education
will be the first tool used; where education is not effective the Bylaw can
be used for enforcement through the Local Government Act. Council collaborate
with the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council for big spill events which occur
in the environment beyond Council’s stormwater network; under the
Resource Management Act they have the ability to issue instant fines,
prosecute, and to issue abatement notices to ensure compliance of both
industrial operators and city residents.
There has been improved communication with the
Regional Council and the stormwater education campaign has been a joint
effort.
There was some discussion as to the best way to
approach consultation for this Bylaw; councillors supported direct engagement
with particularly affected business as part of the wider consultation.
The reviewed Bylaw will enable requirement of
environmental management plans to be at the discretion of Council, for
example at risk areas like the hard stand areas near the inner harbour or
estuary. Further, any costs of Council to rectify a spill into the stormwater
network can be passed onto the polluter rather than the rate payer as was
previously the case.
Committee's recommendation
Councillors
White / Hague
The Regulatory Committee:
a.     Confirm,
in accordance with Section 155 of the Local Government Act 2002, that a
Stormwater Bylaw is the most appropriate way of addressing the issues of:
i.      Protection
of the public stormwater system, and the land, structures, and infrastructure
associated with that network from damage, misuse or loss.
ii.     The
ability to manage the development, maintenance and use of the public
stormwater network, and the land, structures, and infrastructure associated
with that network, and provide for the conditions on which connections to the
public stormwater network may be made or maintained.
iii.    Ensuring that
discharges into the public stormwater network are appropriately managed, and
do not damage the network or compromise the Council’s ability to comply
with any applicable network discharge consent and Council’s water
quality targets.
b.     Approve
the review of the Draft Napier Stormwater Bylaw 2019 and the Statement of
Proposal, and;
c.     Authorise
Officers to proceed with public notification and the special consultative
procedure as prescribed in the Local Government Act for adopting a bylaw.

2.    Delegation to Chief
Executive to Approve Liquor Bans for Large Events

2.1   Purpose
of Report
The purpose of this report is to
request delegated authority to be granted to the Chief Executive to allow for
temporary liquor bans to be imposed during large events.
At the Meeting
The Manager regulatory Solutions spoke to the report,
advising that it is proposed that delegated authority be provided to the
Chief Executive (CE) to impose temporary liquor bans for practical reasons. Requests
often come with an application for a special liquor licence which need to be
acted on within a 20 day period; the Council meeting cycle does not always conform
to that timeline. The CE already has the delegated authority to temporarily
suspend a liquor ban.
The temporary liquor bans imposed by the CE will be advised
to the Council via the quarterly report.
If the CE is not available the delegated authority
would move to the acting CE. Applications for special liquor licences go to
the District Licencing Committee.
It was noted there is no appeal process in place for
declined applications.
In response to questions from councillors it was noted
that Council doesn’t have control over the waste created by special
events; it is the responsibility of the event organisers to submit a waste
management plan, and organise private contractors to remove waste. While
there is an action captured in the Waste Management and Minimisation Plan
(WMMP) to work with the community and event organisers to facilitate better
recycling and food and beverage packaging at events, an event application
cannot be declined due to an insufficient waste management plan; Council can
only educate and advise.
Committee's recommendation
Councillors
Taylor / White
The Regulatory Committee:
a.     Approve
the request to grant delegated authority to the Chief Executive to allow for
temporary liquor bans to be imposed for large events.

3.    Hastings District
and Napier City Council's Joint Local Alcohol Policy (LAP)

Sale and
Supply of Alcohol Act 2012

3.1   Purpose
of Report
The purpose of this report is to
obtain a resolution from Council on setting a date at which the Hastings
District and Napier City Council’s Joint Local Alcohol Policy (LAP) comes
into force.
At the Meeting
The Hastings District and Napier City Council’s
Joint Local Alcohol Policy (LAP) has taken some time to develop.
Through the process of developing this policy there
were locations identified for which it  was felt that density control
would facilitate better community outcomes, such as Flaxmere, Camberley and
Maraenui. The Maraenui community are in support of the LAP.
In discussion a Councillor noted that that communities
should not be singled out and treated differently under this policy due to
demographics. A strength based model for communities should be used, not a
deficit one.
It was foreshadowed that a Notice of Motion may be
brought to the next Council meeting to consider further lobbying of the
Minister of Justice for an urgent review of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol
Act 2012 behind the LAP, due to the continued alcohol related harm occurring in
the community. This would be in addition to the two Remits at the Local
Government New Zealand Conference over the last two years.
It was noted that the LAP would mean licenced cafes
could stay open until two o’clock in the morning. Any implications on
current and potential inner city residents needs to be considered.

4.1   Purpose
of Report
To provide an information update
on the regulatory activity in the city in each quarter.  The report
attached covers the fourth quarter from 1 April until 30 June 2019.
At the Meeting
In response to questions from Councillors, the following
points were clarified:
·
Councillors will be notified whether the number of dogs
registered in this period is typical.
·
The Parkmate app is a payment tool rather than an enforcement
tool, so should not make a difference to the amount of parking infringement
notices issued.
·
The number of dogs euthanised in this quarter is very low
considering the discretion Council has to euthanise under legislation. It is
unclear how Napier’s euthanisation statistics compare to other parts of
the country.
·
There has been increased utilisation of available freedom
camping areas due to growth in this sector rather than inappropriate
management of the existing sites. Any potential increase to the allocated
sites could be reconsidered by the new Council..
