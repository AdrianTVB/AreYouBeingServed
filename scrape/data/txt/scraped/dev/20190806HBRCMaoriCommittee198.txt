Verbal
Update on Current Issues – HBRC Chair
Cr Rex Graham updated the Committee on
current issues, highlighting:
Napier Port share offer:
·
Council voted to proceed with a 45% IPO of
Napier Port and requested Napier Port to undertake an offer of shares.
·
The offer of shared under the priority offer
opened on 23 July and closed on 5 August.
·
The preferential allocation of shares has been
phenomenal and showed strong support from Hawke’s Bay residents,
institutions, tangata whenua, businesses and international investors.
·
Appointed two directors to the Napier Port Board,
being Cr Rick Barker due to his extensive experience and strong union
background and Blair O’Keefe due to his particular Port experience and
competence.
Economic
Development in Wairoa:
·
7% of farms in Wairoa went into production forestation
in 2018.
·
Many farms will follow to change into production
forestation.  This will not enhance the economy in Wairoa in the short
or long term.
·
A small governance group were formed
consisting of the Mayor of Wairoa, the Chair of the Wairoa Taiwhenua
representatives and Rex Graham which will assist to progress land change into
horticulture in Wairoa.
·
It will be an obvious change for Wairoa with
great climate, soils and people.
Kahutia –
Hawke’s Bay Regional Prison project:
·
Cr Rick Barker is working closely with government
and Ngati Kahungunu regarding planting programmes.
·
Hawke’s Bay Regional Prison previously
had both a nursery and vegetable garden and supplied vegetables to prisons
around the country.
·
They also sold their own organically grown
vegetables on the open market, but due to a campaign run by local interest
groups, the nursery and garden closed down, stripping prisoners from the
opportunity to learn and adapt new skills.
·
Discussions has been held between Cr Barker and
Minister Stuart Nash to re-establish the nursery.
·
A proposal has been put forward to ministers
and their senior staff and a business case has since been developed.
·
Minister Stuart Nash agreed to assist with
this project and to re-establish in possibly four months.
·
$2,9million available from a Government fund
to re-establish the nursery in the prison.
·
It has been proposed that Council management
discuss a possible development of a business case to utilise prisoners to get
involved in Council environmental work and projects (i.e planting,
forestation, fencing etc) to assist prisoners to gain valuable life skills
and integrate back into society.
·
It has been reported that Ngati Kahungunu has
planted 20,000 seedlings in 2018 grown in the prison nursery scheme.
TANK Plan
Change:
·
Negotiations still ongoing and in the final
stages of the Plan Change.
·
All have a vision for a very dynamic environment
for the Heretaunga Plains.
·
Currently have the highest GDP growth in the
whole of New Zealand – driven by primary industries, creating wealth
and jobs.
·
It is hoped to do all this in harmony with the
environment.
·
Expect to have the Plan Change approved soon.
Local
Hawke’s Bay Elections 2019:
·
Nominations currently open and closes at noon
on Friday, 16 August .
·
Voting opens on 20 September and closes at noon
on 12 October.
·
Hinewai Ormsby are standing as candidate in
the Napier constituency and encourage members to support her.
