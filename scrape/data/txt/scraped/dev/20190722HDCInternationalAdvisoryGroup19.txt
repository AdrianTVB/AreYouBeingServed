(Document 19/727) 

Councillor Watkins spoke to his detailed report regarding the China visit undertaken 
in  June  2019,  highlighting  the  key  points  and  acknowledging  the  supporting  work 
that had been undertaken by Lee Neville and Lesley Chu. 

Mayor Hazlehurst joined the meeting at 3.12pm. 

The meeting congratulated Councillor Watkins and the team for the amount of work

Councillor Dixon/Councillor Travers  

That the report of Councillor Kevin Watkins titled “Report on China Visit June 
2019” be received.

CONSIDERATION OF GENERAL BUSINESS ITEMS  

This  item  was  addressed  in  two  parts  during  the  meeting,  but  all  discussion  has 
been included here for ease of reference. 

Rion  Roben,  NZ  China  Friendship  Society  (HB  Branch)  advised  that  Rong  (Alicia) 
Huang would be the alternate representative if he was unable to attend a meeting. 

Rion Roben also added to comments made at a previous meeting, reporting that in 
2016  the  NZCFS  and  the  HB  Youth  Orchestra  had  organised  for  the  Youth 
Orchestra  to  visit  China.    The  trip  had  been  successful  and  the  following  year  a 
Chinese orchestra had visited here.  A return trip to China had been undertaken this 
year  as  a  result  of  fundraising  by  NZCFS  and  further  exchanges  involving  young 
musicians were planned in 2020 and 2021.   

The  Society  is  hoping  to  be  able  to  manage  such  exchanges  through  its  own 
fundraising efforts but signalled that it may need to ask for support from IAG.  The 
Society would like to be formally included right from the early stages of planning for 
any  delegation  exchanges  and  would  like  to  see  long  term  regular  exchanges  of 
youth orchestras.

Rion  Roben  also  advised  that  there  had  previously  been  a  successful  exchange 
programme  in  place  with  the  School  of  Botany  and  Horticulture  in  China.    Only 
Nelson  has  continued  with  this  exchange  programme  and  it  was  being  suggested 
that  this  programme  be  revived.    Once  the  National  President  of  NZCFS  returns 
from a current visit, the necessary information would be put into a report to the IAG 
in the form of a proposal to be considered. 

Rizwaana  Latiff  reported  on  the  Multicultural  Federation  AGM  –  adjusted  Treaty 
Pathway to multiculturalism in NZ.  A visit to local marae in Hastings and Napier is 
being organised and an application will be made to the Federation for funding. 

The  Women’s  Wellbeing  Framework  was  launched  last  year  and  there  were  four 
key points that migrant women wanted addressed.  Funding is being applied for – 
Hawke’s Bay was the pilot area for the North Island. 

Rizwaana invited all members to the Asians in the Bay Awards.  She also reported 
on  an  international  conference  she  had  attended  in  Singapore  last  month,  with 
delegates from 40 countries.  Key note speaker had been King Abdullah of Jordan. 

Mrs Too/Mayor Hazlehurst  
 
That  the  verbal  General  Business  reports  from  Rion  Roben  and  Rizwaana 
Latiff be received.
