Section
7.1         Adoption
of the Annual Plan 2019/20
PURPOSE
The matter for consideration by the
Council is the adoption of the Annual Plan 2019-20.
Resolved:  19.53
Moved:       Cr
Ian Sharp
Seconded:  Cr
David Tennent
That
having considered all matters raised in the report:
In
regards to the Annual Plan 2019/20 Council resolves to
a)   Adopt
the Annual Plan 2019/20 in accordance with section 95 of the Local Government
Act 2002.
b)   Delegate
responsibility to the Chief Executive to approve the final edits required to
the Annual Plan in order to finalise the documents for printing and
distribution.
Carried
Mayor Walker sought clarification about the definition of
revaluation reserves.
It was confirmed that accounting policy requires the organisation to
revalue assets regularly.  The amount shown in the revaluation reserve is
an accounting amount only and does not constitute cash in the
organisation’s bank.
Cr Sharp spoke to the motion and provided his congratulations about
the way the Annual Plan document was presented.  He noted that the Council
could be proud of the document despite some of the funding challenges faced.
Cr Tennent concurred with Cr Sharp and highlighted that the big
challenges would start in the next year’s annual plan and following. He
raised concern that this meant an 0.5% rates increase from the  LTP last
year.  Cr Tennent highlighted that the Council was currently experiencing
good will in the community which may be difficult to continue with ongoing
affordability issues.
Cr Minehan highlighted the importance of major costs needing to come
to elected members attention in a timely way to enable them to make considered
decisions gv.  Cr Minehan expressed that although the rates increase is
higher than was initially planned for, he was comfortable overall with the
increase of 4.59%.
Cr Aitken thanked staff for the work done on the plan.  He
outlined that although the rates increase was close to what was set out in the
Long Term Plan, that rates rises are an ongoing concern in the community.
Over time this had potential to create big affordability issues and raised the
importance of Council giving thought to how rates are allocated overall.
Mayor Walker highlighted the big capital work programmes driving
this increased investment and the importance of remaining committed to
delivering on them in future.  Mayor Walker raised the issue of the
framework around water on a local, regional and national basis and suggested
that the Council needed to work carefully with partners to see how it could get
financial help regionally and nationally.
Mayor Walker also considered that a robust process had been followed
to reach the rates increase level of 4.59% and that she was proud of the services
being delivered.  Although the increase was higher than planned for
initially, the increase across the district is lower than most Hawke’s
Bay counterparts.
Cr Sharp raised that it was important to focus on all the
improvements being made rather than the cost.
7.2         Fees
and Charges 2019/20
PURPOSE
The matter for consideration by the
Council is the adoption of the Fees and Charges for 2018/19
Resolved:  19.54
Moved:       Cr
Brent Muggeridge
Seconded:  Cr
Tim Aitken
That
having considered all matters raised in the report:
a)         That
the Fees and Charges for the financial year dated 2019/20 as set out in
Attachment A excluding Animal Control Fees be approved.
b)         That
Council give notice pursuant to Section 103 of the Local Government Act 2002
of its intention to prescribe the fees payable for the period 1 July 2019 to
30 June 2020 in respect of certificates, authorities, approvals, consents,
and services given or inspections made by the Council under the Local
Government Act 2002, the Building Act 2004, the Building (Infringement
Offences, Fees, and Forms) Regulations 2007, the Amusement Devices
Regulations 1978, the Resource Management Act 1991, Health (Registration of
Premises) Regulations 1966, Sale and Supply of Alcohol (Fees) Regulations
2013, the Gambling Act 2003, the Burial and Cremation Act 1964, and the
Central Hawke’s Bay District Council Bylaws as set out in the Fees and
Charges Schedule 2019/20.
Carried
Cr Muggeridge spoke in support of the motion.  He noted that
Council had spent a lot of time debating the fees and charges and raised that
democracy has played its part and that he was pleased that users would pay for
services.
Cr Burne-Field noted her objection to the increase in cemetery fees.
Cr Minehan highlighted the importance that in future Council needed
to consider the direct benefit to community and distribution of those benefits
and the ability for people to pay.
Mayor Walker agreed that these are tough decisions to make and
highlighted that the fees and charges were set on the basis of the Revenue and
Financing Policy in terms of the cost splits which dictate charges.  Mayor
Walker agreed with Councillor Minehan that people’s ability to pay was an
important consideration and highlighted the importance of the rating review.
Mayor Walker spoke about the need for developers to be responsible
for their costs and highlighted that the public had been clear about this
expectation.

Rate
Te Aute
Drainage rates are set on all rateable area of rateable property within the

operations, loan charges and the repayment of loans for the Te Aute Drainage
Scheme area.
The amount
required and the classification is set by the Te Aute Drainage Committee.
Each hectare
of land in each property is classified according to the susceptibility of
that hectare to flooding as follows:
A (100
points), B (80 points), C (15 points), F (3 points), and G (0 points).
The total
number of points is 73614.  The total amount of funding required each
year determines how much each of these points are worth. In this way, the
total amount required is apportioned on a pro rata basis using the weightings
on each hectare.
The total
amount of funding required for 2019/20 is $17,250
The amount
per point is 23.43304 cents including GST.
The Te Aute
drainage scheme area is defined by reference to the classification list
establishing the graduated scale.
Approach to Rating
Rates are
set and assessed under the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002 on all rateable
rating units on the value of the land and improvements as supplied by
Quotable Value New Zealand Limited.  .  The last rating revaluation
was carried out in September 2018 and is effective from 1 July 2019.
The objectives of the council's rating
policy is to:
(i)    spread the incidence of rates as
fairly as possible
(ii)   be consistent in charging rates
(iii)  ensure all ratepayers pay their fair share
for council services
(iv)  provide the income needed to meet the
council’s goals.
The Central Hawke’s Bay District
Council rating system provides for all user charges and other income to be
taken into account first, with the rates providing the balance needed to meet
the council's objectives.
Rating Base
The rating base will be the database
determined by the contracted rating service provider.  Because this
database is constantly changing due to change of ownership, subdivision,
regular revaluations, change of status from rateable to non-rateable (and
reverse), the rating base is not described in detail in this policy.
Due Dates for Rate Payments
Pursuant to Section 24 of the Local
Government (Rating) Act 2002, the following dates are proposed to apply for
assessing the amount of each instalment of rates excluding metered water
rates for the year 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020. Each instalment will be

Carried
Mayor Walker went through each of the rates being struck.
Cr Sharp  highlighted that the rates split showed the philosophy
of the Council in terms of user pays.  It also showed the importance of the
rates review and how it will impact ratepayers, including the ability to pay,
fairness and who pays for which service.
Cr Tennent agreed that the rates review was an important step going
forward, particularly in terms of the Uniform Annual General Charge (UAGC).
He noted that most rural districts are looking at spreading that cost over whole
district particularly in relation to wastewater treatment.
Mayor Walker raised that the UAGC was significantly lower than last
year based on the changes to the Revenue and Financing Policy.  She
highlighted that the changes were based on revaluations and the big shift in
lower value residential properties.  Because of this, Mayor Walker noted
that she was unapologetic for the decision but noted that long term viability
needed to be considered carefully.
7.4         Adoption
of WMMP for Consultation
PURPOSE
The matter for consideration by the Council is to receive
and adopt the waste minimisation and management plan to be released for
community consultation.
Resolved:
19.56
Moved:       Cr Gerard Minehan
Seconded:  Cr
Kelly Annand
That having considered all
matters raised in the report:
a)         That
the WMMP is adopted for consultation
Carried
Cr Burne-Field congratulated officers on the document and raised
that it was a great start for the community and would likely gather momentum as
it continues.  She also highlighted that it would be good to see that
‘Waste Free CHB’ was branded.
Cr Minehan thanked the Solid Waste Management Reference Group and
staff involved. Cr Minehan also raised the need to consult with existing
contractors to make it work effectively..
Cr Annand concurred with Cr Minehan that it was good to see
community involvement and passion in the waste space.
Cr Sharp congratulated the Solid Waste Management Reference Group  on
the positive aspirations in the document.  He highlighted that education
was important and that the Council would need to invest in it, and that he
looked forward to the community embracing the aspirations.
Mayor Walker reflected that the document showed a good balance of
aspiration and action and ways that funding could be supported.  She
raised that community engagement needed to provide an opportunity for people to
provide clear answers on the things that mattered most to them.
Cr Minehan acknowledged the input provided from Clint Deckard as
part of the reference group.
He noted that this document was a good first step to effective and
affordable waste infrastructure for the community.
7.5         Endorsement
of WWTP Environment Court Response
PURPOSE
The matter for consideration by the Council is to endorse
the report responding to the supplementary enforcement order issued from HBRC
through the environment court in 2018.
Resolved:  19.57
Moved:       Cr David Tennent
Seconded:  Cr
Gerard Minehan
That having considered all
matters raised in the report:
a)         That
Council endorses the report responding to the Environment Court in relation
to the Waipawa Wastewater Treatment Plant.
Carried
Mayor Walker highlighted that although the outcomes in the report
were operational, that the report provided Council with the opportunity to lend
support by endorsing it.
Cr Tennent noted his confidence that the Council had done their best
to come up with some good options going forward.  He noted clear direction
from the community through Project Thrive that Wastewater should be disposed to
land, rather than into the river.
Mayor Walker noted that this was a  big step forward for an
important priority project and that she looked forward to seeing the response
from the Environment Court.
The meeting was suspended at 10.04 for morning tea.
The meeting reconvened at 10.29am
7.6         Remits
for consideration at LGNZ 2019 Conference
PURPOSE
The purpose of this report is for Council to consider its
position in relation to the 2019 LGNZ AGM Remits.
Resolved:  19.58
Moved:       Cr Ian Sharp
Seconded:  Cr
Gerard Minehan
That, having considered all matters raised in the
report, the report be noted.
That Council confirm voting rights on behalf of
Central Hawke’s Bay District Council to Mayor Alex Walker and
Councillor Tim Chote at the AGM.
That Council confirm Councillor Gerard Minehan and
Chief Executive Monique Davidson also attend the AGM to represent Central
Hawke’s Bay District Council.
That Council support the following remits at the LGNZ
AGM: (Note – delete those remits Council does not support)
" 1. That LGNZ calls on the government to
include local government representation (as determined
by local government) at all levels of policy
development, technical risk and resilience assessment,
and data acquisition on climate change
response policies - with an emphasis on climate
adaptation:
policy; legal; planning; and financial compensation regimes."
“5. That LGNZ advocates for enabling
legislation that would allow councils to require all guest
accommodation providers to register with the
council and that provides an efficient approach to
imposing
punitive action on operators who don’t comply.”
“6. That LGNZ recommend to the
government the funding of additional research into the effects of
nitrates in drinking water on human health,
and/or partner with international public health
organisations to promote such research, in
order to determine whether the current drinking water
standard
for nitrate is still appropriate for the protection of human health.”
“7. That LGNZ initiates a review of
Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act (1987)(LGOIMA)
request management nationally with a view to establishing clear and
descriptive reporting for and by local authorities that will create a
sector-wide picture of:
• Trends in the volume and nature of
LGOIMA requests over time.
• Trends in users.
• The impacts of technology in terms of
accessing information sought and the amount of
information now held by local authorities (and
able to be requested).
• The financial and resource impacts on
local authorities in managing the LGOIMA function.
That LGNZ use the data obtained to:
• Identify opportunities to streamline
or simplify LGOIMA processes.
• Share best practice between local
authorities.
• Assess the value of a common national
local government framework of practice for
LGOIMA requests.
• Identify opportunities to advocate for
legislation changes on behalf of the sector (where
these
are indicated).”
“8. That LGNZ encourages member councils
to consider using environmentally friendly weed control methods.”
“9. LGNZ calls on central government to
take action as recommended by the Law Commission in its 2014 report on
“Liability of Multiple Defendants” to introduce a cap on the
liability of councils in New Zealand in relation to building defects claims
whilst joint and several liability applies.”
“10. That LGNZ, in conjunction with
central government, urgently focus on the development and implementation of
a broader range of funding and financing tools in respect of
community/social housing provision, than those which currently exist in the
housing needs space. These should include funding to support the operation,
upgrade and growth of council housing portfolios and, where a council
chooses, access to Income Related Rents for eligible tenants.”
“11. That LGNZ investigate the ability
of the sector to collaborate in procuring open-source designs and plans for
bulk infrastructure that are largely similar, with an initial approach to
look at water and wastewater treatment facilities.”

in the application of CoPTTM.

ensure those in charge of Traffic
Management on worksites remain current in the
required competencies.

ensure the traffic management at worksites is
independently audited at a sufficient frequency
to ensure compliance, and that a significantly robust system is put in place
to enable enforcement of compliance.

of their duties with respect to their role as Road Controlling Authorities
