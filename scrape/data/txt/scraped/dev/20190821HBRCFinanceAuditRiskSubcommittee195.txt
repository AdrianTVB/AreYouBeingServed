The latest 3 yearly audit of security compliance
as part of a recertification process found that Revera had a number of process
related issues resulting in its being non-compliant, hence DIA has taken over direct
operations management of the security systems.

There is no business impact for the Regional
Council and the service will continue to run, and DIA has advised it is satisfied
with the progress being made toward resolving the issues pointed out in the
Audit report.

Resolution of issues will be followed by an
external validation process to ensure that all risks have been properly closed before
