1.1   Purpose
of Report
The Hearings Committee has been
delegated, by Council, the power to hear, consider and decide objections made
under section 33B of the Dog Control Act 1996 (‘the Act’).
An objection has been made by
Darren Melling in response to two dogs being classified as menacing dogs under
section 33A of the Act; a Hearing is therefore required.
At the Meeting
The Chair took the papers as read, and requested Mr
Burton to speak to the incidents leading to the classification directly.
Council Officer’s Report – Warranted
Animal Control Officer, Mr Luke Burton
Mr Burton spoke first to his credentials as a
warranted Animal Control Officer.
He then advised that just after 8pm on 3 January 2019,
Council received a complaint in relation to two dogs who were roaming earlier
that day and had rushed a young man on his bicycle and bailed up a neighbour
in his driveway.
Mr Burton, on further investigation, identified a
third gentleman who had also been rushed by the two dogs while walking
another dog down the street.
The dogs were identified as ‘Boss’ and
‘Maia’, both registered to Mr Darren Melling. While the witnesses
identified both dogs as being aggressive, it was noted that the white dog
(that is, ‘Boss’) was particularly so.
Mr Burton interviewed Mr Melling and his partner in
relation to the incidents; Mr Melling advised during the interview that the
dogs were intended as guard dogs as there had been several instances of
burglary on the street. He advised during the interview that he usually
locked the gate at the front of his property but was aware that he had not done
this on the day in question. This was in conflict with a statement made at a
separate time whereby he suggested that his neighbour must be letting the
dogs out of the fencing. Mr Burton noted that the fencing was quite secure as
long as the gate was latched at the front; he had not had the opportunity to
fully assess the fencing towards the back of the property.  Mr Whyte,
Team Leader Animal Control, advised that the fencing was not fully secure
further round the property.
Mr Burton advised that when observing
‘Boss’ and ‘Maia’ in their home environment they
appeared friendly. However he had assessed them as territorially aggressive
based on the several independent reports of incidents.
An attack rating evaluation was completed for each
dog, with a score of 28 being allocated to both animals. In assessing the
incidents Mr Burton took into account the busy dairy and school entrance in
the vicinity of the property. Following the investigation and evaluation both
dogs were classified as menacing under s33A of the Dog Control Act. Further
to the classification Mr Melling was infringed for failure to confine the
dogs under s52a of the Dog Control Act 1996.
It was noted that there is a neighbourly dispute
between Mr Melling and one of the gentlemen who made a statement in relation
to being bailed up by the dogs. It is this neighbour who Mr Melling suggested
was unlatching his gate and letting the dogs roam.
Appellant – Mr Darren Melling
In the absence of the appellant Mr
Melling’s statements were taken as read by the Panel.
The Hearing moved into Deliberations at 2.02pm
Committee's
Decision
Councillors
Wise/ Wright
THAT the classification of ‘Boss’ and
‘Maia’ as menacing dogs under s33A of the Dog Control Act 1996 be
upheld.
Carried
Deliberation Notes
In making its decision,
the Panel gave consideration to the following:
a.    The
evidence which forms the basis for the original classification
The Panel noted the extensive
incident file notes in relation to both dogs, including several prior
instances of roaming.
Although there was some concern
expressed at the natural difficulties inherent to neighbourly disputes, it
was noted that the three separate incidents of 3 January were corroborated by
independent witnesses.
b.    Any
steps taken by the owner to prevent any threat to the safety of persons and
animals
No specific steps by the owner to
prevent any threat to the safety of persons or animals have been identified
by Animal Control Officers.
c.    The
matters advanced in support of the objection; and
It was noted that a duty of care
on behalf of the public is incumbent on Council; a proactive preventative
stance was considered appropriate in this instance to ensure protection from
the actions of animals identified as actively aggressive and not fully
secured.
d.    Any
other relevant matters.
Noting the extensive history of
complaints in relation to the animals, this classification provides a
scaffold for any further enforcement work required should the dogs come to
Council’s attention again.
The meeting closed at 2.07pm
Approved and adopted as a true and accurate record of the
meeting.
