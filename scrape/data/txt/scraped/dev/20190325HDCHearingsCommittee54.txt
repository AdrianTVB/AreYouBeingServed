in response to questions from the committee, included:

Some existing office buildings had dedicated
parking spaces.
·
Provisions requiring owners to
install a lift, if there were more than 15 or 20 people in the building, had stifled
some development.

work needed to sell their building.
·
The variation would help address CBD security,
housing shortages and reduce the outward spread of residential development in
the district.

in shops instead of retail use.

clarification were sought from Council Officers.  The main points that

not interchangeable.

studio apartments.
·
Need to address and mitigate potential
risks such as quality of development, noise and any adverse alcohol related
impacts.
·
35m2 was too small as a gross floor apartment area and they
could come back to the council with a suggested alternative area if requested.
·
The Health Board had not submitted on
the effect of removing outdoor living areas and people not having access to
such areas.
·
The Board had submitted to the
previous review of the District Plan in regard to the effect of not requiring
outdoor living areas and maintaining the character of the area.  Nearby
green spaces would assist.
Questions of
clarification were sought from Council Officers.  The main points that
were addressed in response to questions from the committee, included:
·
Applications for licensed premises
were addressed as restricted discretionary activities and the processing
planner would assess which parties were deemed to be adversely affected and needed
to be notified.
·
There were a number of aspects the
council could address and work had begun on a creative design guide.
·
Officers did not know how many
existing liquor licences had been issued in this area.  They relevant
council officers could be asked to attend the hearing if this information was
requested.

hearing.  She advised that she supported having appropriate guidelines
in the District Plan regarding a mix of apartment sizes in relation to this
variation.
