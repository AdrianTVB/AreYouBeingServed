1.1   Purpose
of Report
That the Committee review and
provide feedback to Council on the Annual Plan 2019/20 underlying documents prior
to the final adoption of the reports.
At the Meeting
The Chief Financial Officer spoke to the latest
version of the Draft Annual Plan and Consultation Document (tabled at the
meeting), and highlighted the following points:
·
On 15 March 2019, Council were advised that there would be an
average rates increase of 5.9% for 2019/20. Since that meeting information
has been received indicating that kerbside recycling costs would increase
further bringing the average rates increase to 6.4%.
·
It is proposed to spread the increased costs of recycling
across a three year period to smooth the rating impact.
·
Council has received expert advice that recycling is likely to
cost $72-$95 per ratepayer, and officers have budgeted on the higher figure
of $95 per ratepayer.
In response to questions it was clarified that the
updates and amendments to the underlying documents are simply tidying up
policies, which will be fully reviewed in the 2019/20 year ahead of the Long
Term Plan.
It was noted that any feedback from the Committee
would be required over the next few days, and prior to the documents being
taken to Council on 2 April 2019.

Management Report March 2019
Type of Report:
Information
Legal Reference:

Document ID:

Reporting Officer/s &
Unit:
Adele Henderson, Director
Corporate Services
2.1   Purpose
of Report
To provide the Audit and Risk
Committee (Committee) with an update on progress with risk management work and
to report on the highest rated risks.
At the Meeting
Ross Franklin spoke to the report noting that there
have been no significant changes. It was noted that work within the register
has been limited due to current workloads and the Manager Business Excellence
and Transformation being seconded to another area of Council. Once the team
returns to full capacity the draft updated policy and strategy will be
reviewed and will then be brought to the Committee.
In response to questions, the following points were
clarified:
·
Council’s major projects are not currently sitting within
the Sycle risk register as they are dealt with on a project by project basis.
Each project has a project risk register and a governance structure in place
to monitor this. Any significant risks identified through this governance
structure are elevated to the senior leadership team to be assessed and
identified as strategic organisational risks.
·
Newly identified risks can always be added to Sycle but only
significant risks are raised with the Committee. There will always be risks
that Council has no control over, but risks identified in the risk register
are those that Council is able to mitigate and manage.
·
The Bluff Hill project is currently underway and expected to be
downscaled shortly.
·
The increase of insurance premiums has been identified as a new
risk as this was raised by Council’s insurance brokers. This is
addressed in the insurance arrangements item.
Committee's recommendation
Councillors
Wise / Hague
That Council:
a.     Note
the risk management work being undertaken by the Napier City Council Risk
Committee.
b.     Note
the current Major Project risks.

Property
3.1   Purpose
of Report
To outline Council’s
current insurance programme, discuss any issues and to provide the opportunity
for the Committee to provide feedback for insurance arrangements for the
upcoming financial year 2019/20.
At the Meeting
The Manager Property spoke to the report which notes
the current insurance arrangements, and invited the Committee to provide
feedback into the arrangements for 2019. He advised that an exercise in loss
modelling is currently being carried out by AON for the five Hawke’s
Bay Council’s together with the Manawatu Councils, noting that
benchmarking is necessary to ensure the valuation of infrastructure is sound
and there is a good understanding of replacement values. The current figure
of $120Million is from 2015 and it is timely to reassess this. Council
intends to feed the new figure into the insurance arrangements for 2019;
however, that can be updated at any time.
In discussing the settlement claim, insurance
providers indicated that there may be ramifications in future but this is
unknown.
Committee members requested that the Manager Property
investigate increasing the indemnity limit for crime insurance as well as cyber-crime
cover.
Committee's recommendation
Mayor
Dalton / David Pearson
That Council:
a.     Resolve to
receive the report on current insurance arrangements.
b.     That
any feedback from the committee be considered for incorporation into the
insurance arrangements for the insurance year commencing 1 July 2019.

of Report
To outline the audit arrangements
for the audit of the Napier City Council for the year ending 30 June 2019.
At the Meeting
The Chief Financial Officer spoke to the report and
the Draft Audit Plan for the year ending 30 June 2019 (tabled at the
meeting), which sets out what the auditors intend to cover at the
year-end audit scheduled for 12 August 2019. It was noted that the Audit New
Zealand are currently on site completing the 2018/19 interim audit and there
appears to be a particular focus on bribery and corruption. Audit New Zealand
have requested to come back in June to get a head start on the year end
audit.
The Committee were advised that they now have an
opportunity to comment on any specific areas that they want the auditors to
look at, that have not already been indicated as an area of focus.
It was confirmed that capital projects are already
noted in the plan. The Director Infrastructure Services has completed the
project management framework, which will come through to the senior
leadership team shortly. This is a comprehensive programme linking through to
Sycle and will include the financial information for these projects also.
The Chief Executive advised that the current focus on
bribery and corruption is a direction from Parliament’s Finance and
Expenditure Committee, and that Council has already updated the code of
conduct to make stronger linkages to the State Services Commission standards
of integrity and conduct for public servants.
The Chair directed the Committee to review the draft
audit plan and provide any feedback directly to Council officers.
Committee's recommendation
