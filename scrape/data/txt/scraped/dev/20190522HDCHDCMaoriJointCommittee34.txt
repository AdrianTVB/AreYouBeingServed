FORUM ITEM - 3WATERS REVIEW UPDATE 
(Document 19/482) 
 
Ms Goodlass, Hawke’s Bay LASS displayed a powerpoint presentation (CG-14-
14-00094) providing an overview of the summary of the discussion and themes 
from the workshops held with Māori Committees that would be incorporated into 
any new model recommended. 
 
A  collaborative  approach  had  been  sought  and  worked  together  with  key 
stakeholders  to  determine  and  agree  the  key  principles  to  ensure  collective 
outcomes for this review. The aim of working together in this way  was to bring 
convergence, coherence and cohesion to the project. 
 
Ms Goodlass noted that they had not consulted with iwi and Māori engagement 
had  been  through  a  series  of  meetings  with  Council  Māori  Advisors,  Māori 
Standing  Committees,  Regional  Planning  Committees  and  key  local  Māori 
influencers.  
 
Five meetings had been held with the Wairoa Māori Standing Committee, HDC 
Māori Joint Committee, Napier Māori Consultative Committee and the Hawke’s 
Bay  Regional  Council  Regional  Planning  Committee  and  Māori  Advisory 
Committee and had emphasised the following:  

 

  Water and the environment are interconnected, what we do in one area will 

have consequences for another – One Water. 

  The  cultural  significance  of  water  and  the  impact  of  storm  water and  waste 

water on taonga waterways. 

  We  must  understand  the  reality  for  Māori  facing  three  waters  issues  and 

incorporate Te Ao Māori in any new model. 

  A  new  model  should  incorporate  partnership  in  terms  of  governance  and 
provide  for  Tikanga  practices  as  part  of  its  core  principles  in  infrastructure 
design approach. 
 

Key Principles were: 
  To provide three water services in a way that is affordable and effective  
 
  To provide services that are safe, reliable and resilient 
  To  provide  services  through  a  model  that  enables  a  meaningful  role  for 

Important that this considers now and into the future 

Māori 

  To provide services through a model that has the value of water at the centre  
  Encompasses broad cultural, community and environmental 
  To provide three waters services in a way that supports our urban and rural 

communities 

  Recognises the importance of local employment, economies 
  To provide three waters services that builds enduring capability and capacity 

 

Ms Goodlass advised that the final report would be communicated to the Chief 
Executive  and  leadership  teams  by  the  end  of  May.      During  June  and  July  it

TE KURA NUI - THE MĀORI CULTURAL RESPONSIVENESS FRAMEWORK 
(Document 19/508) 
 
The  Pou  Ahurea  Matua  Principal  Advisor:  Relationships,  Responsiveness  and 
Heritage,  Dr  James  Graham  advised  that  the  redrafting  of  Te  Kura  Nui  was  in 
progress.    The  Information  and  Technology  Services,  media/communications, 
customer  services  and  the  Pou  Ahurea  were  currently  working  with  Information 
Leadership  Group  (a  Christchurch-based  Gold  Microsoft  Partner)  to  re-design 
Sharepoint  Infokete  the  internal  staff  noticeboard.  Te  Kura  Nui,  the  cultural 
framework  would  be  positioned  on  the  front  page  where  the  assessment 
framework could be easily accessed and reported against. 
 
This  would  make  the  framework  more  visible,  meaningful  and  a  tool  that  was  a 
compulsory  check  point  for  officers  to  check  if  they  were  being  responsive  to 
Māori. 
 
It was noted that the use of ancient terminology may not be understood, however 
provided a great overview of the history.  The Te Kura Nui would provide a tool 
that  would  provide  a  lens  over  the  whole  organisation  and  keep  the  Committee 
fully informed. 
 
During  discussions  it  was  suggested  that  when  the  Council  tapestry  is  to  be 
updated it include the history of the Pou.
