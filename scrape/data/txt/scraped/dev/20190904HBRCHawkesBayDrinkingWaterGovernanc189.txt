Jim Graham – Study Tour Feedback
The Chair invited Jim Graham, Principal Advisor - Water Quality,
Water NZ to make his presentation about his study tour of The Netherlands and
Denmark.  Discussions highlighted:
·
the study tour to looked at water suppliers
and the challenges they have with aquifers and distribution networks,
particularly water supplies that don’t use chlorine, including how
those are managed and why these countries chose chlorine free water
·
Chlorine is a substance, used across the globe
to manage risk in water supplies, and is a very effective tool for managing
most micro-biological risks, relatively low in cost and simple to administer.
·
It is possible to have a water supply system
without using Chlorine, and there are examples of this in The Netherlands,
Denmark, Germany, Canada and the USA.
·
If choosing to have a water system without
chlorine, one needs to have other procedures and systems in place to manage
the public health risk water supply is about managing risk.
·
Surface water in The Netherlands is treated
extensively through a five filtration system.
·
Key factors in the Danish systems include
government funded research, comprehensive source water risk assessments,
continuous monitoring of bore levels, groundwater discharge/recharge, network
flow and pressure, meticulous management of storage, and volumetric charging.
Cr Kirsten Wise left at 11.06am.

TANK Plan Change Process Update
Ceri Edmonds, Manager Policy and Planning, and Mary-Anne Baker,
Senior Planner, provided an update on the TANK Plan Change.  Discussions
traversed:
·    In April 2019, staff received and reviewed the feedback from
pre-notification consultation which raised significant issues.
·    Staff suggested a number of amendments to refine the plan as a
consequence of the feedback, noting that Drinking Water Source Protection
Zones was not one of the issues raised.
·    The Regional Planning Committee deferred decision making in
respect of the TANK Plan Change to the 3 July 2019 meeting, then further
deferred from 3 July to 14 August where unfortunately quorum
wasn’t achieved, resulting in the notification decisions now being
presented to the 18 September Regional Planning Committee meeting.
·    A workshop held in advance of the 3 July 2019 meeting essentially
raised four more issues relating to Stream flow enhancement, groundwater
allocation and limits, provisions for tangata whenua (sections 6e, 7 and 8
RMA) and Alignment between the Outstanding Water Bodies Plan Change (PC7) and
the TANK Plan Change.
·
Staff have recommended to RPC that the
Heretaunga Plains numerical model be used to determine the Source Protection Zones,
and for Napier bores an analytical model be used.
·
The 18 September RPC meeting will be asked to
make decisions to enable notification of the proposed Plan Change.

Joint Working Group Activities Update
Liz Lambert gave an update on the activities and work plan of the
Joint Working Group with discussions highlighting:
·
Since the last Governance Committee meeting,
the Joint Working Group has met three times.
·
The JWG continues progressing the priority
actions in its work plan and around TANK Plan Change and the Source
Protection Zones (SPZs).
·
In process of finalising the Arsenic
Communications Protocol
·
Outlining potential contaminant
(Polyfluorinated Alkyl Substance) risk for groundwater at Hawke’s Bay
airport and the Hastings Fire Station.  Testing for PFAS has found no
detectible levels in soil and sediment sampling at the airport and the
Hastings Fire Station.
·
The Group’s focus is moving towards the
development of a more integrated and collective work programme, involving the
sharing of good practise, the potential for vocational training and continuing
strong engagement across the entities.
·
The Hawke’s Bay Drinking Water Assessor presented
to the JWG on his annual implementation audit update and updated the group on
what is working well and what opportunities there are for further
improvements.

Regional Three Waters Update
Toni Goodlass, Programme Manager for the Hawke’s Bay Regional
Three Waters Review, gave an update on the status of regional and national
reviews under way.
·
Review by the five Councils has been completed,
noting that there were significant changing factors in regulation and some
further questions to respond to before presenting the recommendations to the
Chief Executives and to each Council.
·
A fund subject to the approval of the Minister
of Local Government and the Minister of Finance has been made available to
provide up to $1 million (each) to assist regional initiatives.
Government has not defined the process as yet and a meeting between Ministers
will be held on 12 September.
·
Expressions of Interest to the Department of
Internal Affairs to access the funding for the next phases of the review will
be made this week.
·
Expect to complete a formal application once
process has been finalised by DIA.
·
Funding will allow to complete the second
phase of the project without requiring co-investment by Council.
Craig Thew,
Hastings District Council provided a National Three Waters update, noting:
·
Government went through a number of issues
relating the Three Waters Skill.
·
One issue was setting up of a regulator
– further cabinet paper due next month which will formulate that entity
and how it will be resourced.
·
In terms of Legislation level – minor
(but important) changes in what’s currently in the Health Act which
effectively will become a Water Bill.
