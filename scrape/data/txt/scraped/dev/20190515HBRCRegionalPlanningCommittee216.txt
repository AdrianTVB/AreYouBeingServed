Call for Items of Business Not on the
Agenda
Recommendation
That
the Regional Planning Committee accepts the following “Minor Items of
Business Not on the Agenda” for discussion as Item 10.
Topic
Raised
by
Request
for a ‘Summary and actions’ from the tangata whenua hui yesterday
Cr Beaven
Ministry
of Environment forum with iwi and tangata whenua on Friday and request for
members to note items they would like to put forward for discussion to Api
as he will attend
Api Tapine
The Chair, Tania Hopmans, invited Riki
Ellison to provide a verbal summary of yesterday’s tangata whenua hui.
Mr Ellison advised that main discussions
focussed on the Outstanding Water Bodies plan change, with a key outcome of the
session being the proposed amended recommendations noting that Ngāti Pahauwera and Te Uru Taumata o Tūhoe have excluded themselves from the
Outstanding Water Bodies process. A written summary of the hui discussions will
be distributed to committee members via email.
The Chair further invited tangata whenua to
add to the discussion, and advised that in terms of the volume of material for
this meeting tangata whenua would prefer that the TANK decision item be
deferred to the next meeting so that they have time to fully consider and
absorb the information to be able to make good decisions.
Because staff are
still incorporating the amendments resulting from the Workshop activity held
prior to the meeting into the Outstanding Water
Bodies Plan Change item, item 7 TANK
Plan Change - Feedback and Recommendations
Following Pre-Notification Consultation will be
considered first.
7.
TANK Plan Change - Feedback and Recommendations Following
Pre-Notification Consultation
Members agreed to defer the decisions on the item to the 3 July RPC
meeting, and to use this time to advise staff of areas where more information
is required, for discussion in a workshop prior. Mary-Anne Baker (via Skype) summarised
the item before seeking members’ requests for areas
of focus for the workshop.
·
Focus on the outcomes of the collaborative
process rather than the process itself
·
Permitted small scale water use allocated
5 m3/day (down from 20 m3/day)
·
What additional burden will the Plan Change
put on commercial water users and what behaviour changes will be triggered as
a result, over the next 10 years?
·
High Flow Water allocations – policy and
rules must provide sufficient clarity and direction as to the specific
activities that provide for Māori well-being
·
Application for 20% of total water available
at high flow in Ngaruroro and Tutaekuri catchments with a percentage of the value of that water
paid by the applicants to the Post Settlement Governance Entity whose land
the take is located on – needs full explanation including how the value
of the water is determined, and how it was determined to be the PSGE
receiving proceeds
·
Management options for allocation shortfalls
including transferring water permits from one site to another, and from one
user to another – consider applicant’s compliance history
·
More discussions required about water storage,
water use efficiency as well as consideration of domestic water meter usage
·
Hierarchy of priority values and whether the
view is comprehensive enough
·
future of spring-fed streams, specifically
around augmentation
·
consider contaminant limits for discharges onto
land in source protection zones
·
The inclusion of iwi in the designing of the
stream enhancement schemes – what is the precise nature of the engagement
including how the appropriate iwi is identified
·
High Flow allocations – need to
understand more about this whole provision and how it is intended to work
·
Urban infrastructure and substantial changes to
stormwater discharges by local authorities to meet water quality standards
·
drafting items/questions and concerns to be
forwarded to staff in advance of the workshop to give staff the opportunity
to prepare appropriately
RPC17/19
Resolution
That the Regional Planning Committee defers the item for decision
at the 3 July 2019 meeting.
Tapine/Bailey
CARRIED
6.
Outstanding Water Bodies Plan Change
Tom Skerman introduced the item, highlighting that this Plan
Change has proved to be very challenging in some respects. Queries and
discussions traversed:
·
The proposed recommendations effectively
incorporate the tangata whenua request for modification to capture the Ngāti Pahauwera and Te Uru Taumatua o Tūhoe decisions to not participate in
the Outstanding Water Bodies process
·
Recommendations for the committee to adopt the
proposed list of water bodies for the pre-notification consultation process
with proviso that staff will work with tangata whenua to flesh out any
cultural/spiritual values information gaps
·
Water bodies with Ecological, Wildlife and
other values to be agreed based on values listed as “green” and
“blue” only or green, blue and pink
·
Agreed that all the acquifers be included on
the list
Cr Neil Kirton left the
meeting at 2.43pm
·
Staff suggest identify water bodies for values
that clearly “stand out” and are “superior” when
compared to the other water bodies and are consistently identified as
“outstanding” in published literature – which doesn’t
include those highlighted pink
·
The framework is to identify water bodies that
are to be protected for specific values
·
The Committee agrees that the list for
pre-notification consultation is to include all those listed as having
cultural and spiritual values, plus those highlighted “green” and
“blue” for other values, plus the acquifers.
