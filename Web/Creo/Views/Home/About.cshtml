	<h3>Problem</h3>
	This web app has been built by team Transparency Ninja's as part of <a href="http://govhack.org.nz/">GovHack 2019</a>

	<br />
	<br />
	Every few years billboards appear saying “Vote for Me” and representatives for councils and health boards are voted into office, but do they represent us?
	<br />
	<br />
	How do we know what they are discussing, or even if they attend meetings?
	<br />
	<br />
	Are they discussing important emerging topics

	<ul>
		<li>
			The climate emergency
		</li>
		<li>
			Mental health
		</li>
		<li>
			Water quality and supply
		</li>
		<li>
			Energy availability
		</li>
	</ul>

	<br />
	What are they doing to address these?
	<br />
	<br />
	We could go to a meeting, watch it streamed online, read the minutes, or rely on the news to tell us, but is there a way that technology can help?
	<br />
	<br />
	This is where team Transparency Ninja's came in and created this web app.
	<br />
	<br />
	<h3>Solution</h3>
	Meeting schedules and minutes for 2019 were scraped to produce tables of meetings and councillor attendances. The meeting text was also analysed to produce word counts for a set of meetings.

	<br />
	<br />
	The attendance information was visualised for each organisation, and the word counts turned into word clouds and used for trend analysis of words found in the minutes over time.

	<br />
	<br />
	Mapping layers from stats have been used to provide the initial landing page and navigation, and councillor photos are used in the attendance visualisation.

	<br />
	<br />
	All Source code is stored in our GitHub project: <a href="https://github.com/AdrianTVB/arewebeingserved">AreWeBeingServed?</a>
