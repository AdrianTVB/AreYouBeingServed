Hawke’s
Bay Capability Assessment Report 2019
Ian Macdonald introduced the item and
noted that there has been discussions held this morning in the workshop
around this item.  Further discussions traversed:
·
A monitoring and evaluation process was
undertaking in May 2019 using the same assessment tool used in 2010 and 2015.
·
The Hawke’s Bay Capability Assessment
Report 2019 was produced in June 2019.
·
The CDEM CEG have effectively identified four
areas they considered to be a priority over the life of the next Group Plan
which includes Operational readiness, Group and partner organisational
resilience, Lifelines and Recovery.
·
The existing Operational readiness programme
is progressing well with regular training and exercising.  A Regional
level exercise is planned for 17 October 2019.
·
Organisational resilience, Lifelines and
recovery are all interrelated.
·
Organisational resilience – the biggest
issue identified is the variable approach to business continuance planning by
councils and partner agencies.
·
Lifelines – more challenging as other
Councils and essential service providers (like NZTA, power companies,
telecommunications, Napier Port and HB Airport) are all identified as
Lifeline Utilities and are required to function to the fullest possible
extent.  Oliver Postings has recently taken up a new position within
NZTA and has resigned from his Lifelines role.  The Lifelines Group was
not able to find a Chairperson and currently being run by a committee of core
members.
·
It is noted that Napier Port and HB Airport
are not currently well represented and the intention is to have them involved
in the Lifelines Group activities.
·
Recovery – substantial progress has been
made since the last CAR in 2015.
·
Recovery has been identified as an area
needing further work.
·
The Committee were asked to give direction on
the priorities identified and to identify any other areas for priority with
potential actions to be developed.
·
Further work needs to be done in how to engage
staff better in what their roles and responsibilities are.
·
Lifelines and Recovery will need to be
considered for needing additional resourcing.
CDE2/19

Amendments
to the Group Plan:  Controllers
Took the item as read.
·
An update was given on training and development for new
Controllers and how it fits into the new professional development list of
priorities.
·
Question arose as the whether Councils are putting themselves
at risk by appointing local controllers who do not have the relevant
qualifications, experience and whom has not completed the training.  Is
there any legal obligations to adhere to?
·
Councils are at risk as powers of authority is given to the
Controller as being capable to carry out their responsibilities in any given
emergency.
·
A Controllers Appointments Policy is currently being developed
to address this issue.
·
A request is made that should amendments be made to the Group
Plan:  Controllers, to have some commentary around Controllers’
professional development plan, how it fits into the wider context and who
qualifies as Controller whilst the Controllers are not yet qualified.
