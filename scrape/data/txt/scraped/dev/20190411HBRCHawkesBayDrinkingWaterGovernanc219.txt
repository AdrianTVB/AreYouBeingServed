There were no items raised.
5.
Regional and National "Three Waters"
Reviews
The Chair advised the agenda item has
been withdrawn and asked Toni Goodlass, HB LASS Programme Manager, to deliver
a presentation on the regional 3 Waters review. Discussions covered:
·
Review of service delivery of drinking water,
stormwater and wastewater
·
Main challenges identified are meeting
community expectations, meeting regulatory requirements and the ability to
replace ageing infrastructure or fund and manage new infrastructure
·
Two work streams of Central Government review
are overarching shape and form of regulatory arrangements and service
delivery and supply
·
Proactively engaging with Central Government as ‘key
region’ to provide input to and influence the national review
·
Challenges to be addressed include funding pressures, rising
environmental standards, climate change, seasonal pressure from tourism, and
the recommendations of the Havelock North Inquiry
·
Stage one assessed the current state, issues and opportunities of
three waters services and infrastructure
·
Stage two is short-listing options and models for improving
three waters management and service delivery leading to recommendation of a
preferred service delivery model for the region
·
drainage and flood protection service functions of the Regional
Council are not in the scope of this review
·
Detailed analysis will be completed and
preferred option report delivered to the five CEs at the end of May
·
The joint councils workshop identified key
objectives and principles for funding of infrastructure, resilience (Physical
infrastructure, people and systems), impacts of the three waters systems on
the environment, Community values for water, the role of Māori and the efficient, effective
provision of services
·
Stakeholders have communicated their broad and
varied interests, emphasising that water and the environment are
interconnected, the cultural significance of water and the impact of
stormwater and wastewater on taonga waterways, understanding that Te Ao
Māori, governance and tikanga, need to be integrated into any new model
·
Examples of different Models were:
o
Centre of Excellence (RATA)
o
Shared Services (like Masterton &
Carterton)
o
Joint Procurement
o
Shared Services Business Unit (like Northland
Transport Alliance)
o
Management CCO (like Wellington Water)
o
Asset Owning CCO (like Watercare in Auckland)
·
Options undergoing detailed evaluation are:
o
“Status Quo” – noting that
the future status quo will be considerably different and will therefore be evaluated
as a modified status quo.
o
Three waters shared services business unit with
current Council funding
o
Three waters regional management CCO with current
council and regional funding
o
Three waters regional asset owning CCO with
regional funding
o
marginal costs and benefits of a sub-national
management CCO will also be considered
·
potential government funding support for
transition costs
·
Regulatory changes proposed for private
drinking water supplies that will also impact on TAs
·
Private supplies are very variable and
proposed regulation would add risk to TAs
·
DHB requested that quantity and peak demand
periods be considered as part of the review, and offers a different
perspective that could add value to the process with participation of the
Public Health team
·
Issues of inequity are a key part of options
assessment
DWG20/19
Resolution
That the
Hawke’s Bay Drinking Water Governance Joint Committee receives and
notes the “Regional and National “Three Waters”
Reviews” staff report.

CARRIED
Craig Thew and Nic Jones summarised discussions
at the joint working group workshop with DIA, Ministry of Health & MfE officials
held mid-March, highlighting:
·
Joint working group invited to make submissions
to the Advisory on the presentations made
·
Three breakout groups focussed on Drinking
Water, Wastewater and Stormwater and the Cultural Values Iwi group discussion
group was separate, which totally missed the “total awa”
considerations
·
very little awareness of the officials about what
the Joint Working Group and Joint Committee are doing
·
to present Governance structures, time concerns
and issues raised at future joint committee meeting
·
Key issues raised by the working group included
the inability to be confident of safe drinking water, compliance does not
translate to safe, a shortage of investment in research nationwide including
training for water providers, weak water source protection measures, the
current system and infrastructure, affordability and willingness to pay, as
well as risk appetite.
·
two strategies being followed nationally, with
the Drinking Water work on Regulatory change proposed to be presented to
Cabinet in June
·
concerns raised around the impact of the removal
of Drinking Water assessors from the Public Health team and proposal for
separate drinking water regulator (leading with drinking water)
·
understanding choices and alternatives for
disinfection of drinking water (Netherlands 20 year journey to current systems)
– duty of care to demonstrate that you can do without reticulated
disinfection is onerous, and extremely expensive exercise
·
agreed by group to retain the option to
investigate options other than reticulated disinfection with chlorine
Resolution
DWG21/19      That the Hawke’s Bay Drinking Water Governance Joint Committee
receives and notes the “Verbal report and response of the Joint
Working Group”

Update on CHB Water Issues
The Chair noted that this item specifically relates to quantity. Discussions
highlighted:
·
A Taskforce has been created and HBRC has an
application to the Provincial Growth Fund relating to water security and
quality in the region
·
Central Hawke’s Bay District Council
surveyed households in the Tikokino and Otane townships as part of
investigating the security of private supplies
·
Following the survey results, the CHB Water
Taskforce agreed that the seemingly low number of residents still experiencing
issues with their supply security will be dealt with on an individual basis –
first and foremost through contact the Regional Council’s grant scheme
·
Mark advised that the regional council can
assist with funding water storage tanks through the Sustainable Homes
programme where eligible ratepayers can now borrow up to $20,000 at 6% over
10 years paid back through a voluntary targeted rate
·
Regional policy to ‘give access’
to water and resource consent requirements to have ‘no more than
minor’ effects on efficient water takes in the vicinity

Drinking Water Governance Joint Committee receives and notes the “Update

Development Of Source Protection Zones
Ceri Edmonds provided an update on the development of drinking

discussions highlighting:

findings of the numerical model have been peer
reviewed by GNS, who concluded the approach is appropriate and received
“in principle” support from the joint working group 12 March
·
the report will be presented to the next
Committee meeting
·
the ability to apply a flexible approach to
the policy to allow for changes to groundwater conditions which may
affect the extent of the zones has been adopted by Environment Canterbury and
is being considered here
·
the regional council has engaged with Environment Canterbury
planners and been advised that no specific legal advice in respect of the SPZ
maps was sought, nor was this approach challenged through the plan change
process
·
Council commenced pre-notification
consultation January-March and a number of responses received are yet to be considered
by staff
·
Staff will present the feedback to the 15 May
Regional Planning Committee meeting
