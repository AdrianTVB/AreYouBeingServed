Councillor Boag declared her involvement with the Disability
Advisory Group in relation to the Napier Disability Strategy in agenda item 1.
Public forum
Napier Disability Strategy
Lynne Gibson spoke in support of the draft Napier Disability
Strategy, noting that an inclusive pre-consultation process has taken place
with a number of organisations within the disability community. It was noted
that the Napier Disability Advisory Group has worked in conjunction with key
departments of Council to compile the strategy.
Jacqui Lee of the Napier Hearing Association also spoke in
support of the draft Napier Disability Strategy and thanked those involved to
date for giving members of the disability community a chance to be heard. The
strategy is an exciting and thought provoking opportunity.
Paul Redman and Shelly Te Uki – Napier Sailing
Club
Paul spoke on behalf of the Napier Sailing Club (the Club) requesting
funding to assist with the cost of the breastwork upgrade. The current state of
the breastwork is a safety concern for the Club, which shares their facilities
with a number of other water based sports groups. Paul presented photos to
Council which highlighted the work required, and noted that the Club also
requests support from Council regarding resource consents. Speaking notes tabled
at the meeting (Attachment A).
In response to questions from Councillors the following
points were clarified:
·
The proposed works have taken projected rising sea levels into
account; the sill height has been raised around 250ml to account for this.
·
The Club embraces and welcomes public access and are happy for
this to be formalised.
·
At this stage the Club is only looking at upgrading the 80m wall.
There are future plans for an ongoing marina but this will be at the
Club’s cost. At that time, assistance from Council may be required
regarding consents. It was noted that the new marina would come off the
proposed breastwork.

This report summarises the development of the Napier
Disability Strategy and requests approval to release it for community feedback
prior to its finalisation for adoption by Council.
At the Meeting
Nicki
Young, NZ Sign Language Communicator,
was acknowledged and welcomed to the meeting.
The Manager Community Strategies spoke to the report,
outlining the process undertaken to date in developing the draft strategy
through early consultation with a number of groups within the disability
community.
Councillors spoke in support of the strategy noting
that this is a robust, aspirational document and they are looking forward to
receiving community feedback through the consultation process.
In response to questions from Councillors it was
clarified that at this stage the strategy is limited to Council services and
how those services are provided. Once the strategy has been implemented
Council could begin looking at a full community disability strategy.

2.1   Purpose
of Report
To seek Council’s approval
for a grant to the Napier Sailing Club towards the cost of upgrading the
existing breastwork and boardwalk immediately in front of the Napier Sailing
Club Clubhouse.
At the Meeting
It was noted that funds are available through the

a responsibility to spend those funds on inner harbour works.
Councillors were happy to see that public access will
be formalised and agreed that this work is essential for health and safety
reasons.

3.1   Purpose
of Report
To bring to Council the
determination of the Local Government Commission in relation to the 2018
representation review.
At the Meeting
A Councillor spoke to the determination, suggesting
that there were no grounds for a judicial review or appeal. The determination
gave weight to the work completed by Council officers, and also noted that
further work was recommended for the next review in relation to ward
boundaries and community boards.
Councillors against the change to a ward-only system commented
that the system was inappropriate for Napier and reduced the number of
elected members that the public could vote for. Those in support noted that
the ward only system would simplify the voting process.
Committee's recommendation
Councillors
Boag / Wright
That the Strategy and Infrastructure
Committee:
a.     Receive
the Local Government Commission determination on the 2018 representation
review.
b.     Note
that Officers will make the appropriate arrangements for the 2019 elections
in liaison with Council’s election provider.

Governance
4.1   Purpose
of Report
To obtain a decision from the
Council on the ordering of candidates’ names on voting documents, as per
the Local Electoral Act 2001.
At the Meeting
In response to questions from Councillors, the Team
Leader Governance confirmed that at the 2016 Local Government elections, Napier
was the only Council in the region using the randomised order for
candidates’ names on voting papers; however, there have been strong
indications from the other Councils in the region that they intend to move in
this direction for the 2019 elections. It was noted that although the
Government elected not to enforce this it is generally accepted that randomised
order is best practice; research suggests that alphabetical order favours
candidates at the beginning of the alphabet.
Committee's recommendation
Councillors
McGrath / Taylor
That the Strategy and Infrastructure
Committee:
a.     Endorse
the presentation of candidates’ names in random order on voting
documents for the 2019 Local Government Elections.

of Report
To consider and approve the
reviewed Napier Roll of Honour for display at the War Memorial Centre site.
At the Meeting
Councillors acknowledged the hard work of those
involved to date to ensure that the roll of honour is as accurate as
possible.
In response to questions from Councillors management
confirmed that, where possible and practicable, attempts were made to contact
the families of those identified to be removed from the roll of honour. A
Councillor noted their unease in relation to removing names from the roll of
honour where the family could not be contacted.
Committee's recommendation
Mayor
Dalton / Councillor Taylor
That the Strategy and Infrastructure
Committee:
a.     Approve
the Napier Roll of Honour as an official Civic list of war dead for display
at the War Memorial Centre site, and:
b.     Approve
that 15 identified names from the 1995 Roll of Honour deemed by research to
have good and legitimate reason for removal are not carried forward to the
revised Roll of Honour.

Community Strategies
6.1   Purpose
of Report
This report provides the feedback
received during consultation on concept design options for a War
Memorial.  It is recommended that Council select an option in order to
proceed with development of a concept brief and subsequent construction of a War
Memorial for Napier.
At the Meeting
Virgil Troy of SIL Research and the Manager Community
Strategies spoke to the report, outlining the consultation process undertaken
and noting that 65% preferred the garden option. Although other options were
submitted, none of those substantially departed from the concepts consulted
on.
In response to questions from Councillors the
following points were clarified:
·
The responses did not indicate that preference for an indoor
option was diluted by having more than one; there was a clear preference for
the garden option.
·
The majority of the 172 submissions that had been removed were
due to incomplete or unusable responses. 10 were assessed as allegedly being
from the same person or double-ups which was validated through checking IP
addresses and other methods. It was noted that removing those 10 submissions
does not affect the overall result.
·
The survey was targeted at Napier residents therefore
submissions from outside of Napier were removed. No special requests were
made by non-residents in their submissions explaining why they considered
their views should be included.
·
Over sampling is considered best practice to ensure that enough
clean data is achieved to present accurate results.
Councillor Brosnan acknowledged the Chair’s
recommendation in the officer’s report and moved a substantive motion
which had been prepared in consultation with members of the public actively
following the matter, including Guy Natusch. The substantive motion draws on
key items taken from the submissions and was assessed against criteria
including ‘important elements’, ‘what the community said’
and ‘outcome wants’; these criteria were tabled at the
meeting (Attachment B). The intention is that officer’s at
the direction of Council, prepare a final design to be adopted by Council in
five months’ time.
Management noted that the proposed timeline was of
concern given the level of work required and that this may not be practically
achievable.
In response to questions, Councillor Brosnan clarified
that the new roll of honour would be displayed and the old physical roll of
honour would be incorporated into the site in another way based on the
recommendation of an appropriate committee. The location of the memorial will
still be the floral clock site in accordance with Council’s decision of
27 September 2017, but raised to forecourt level.
Councillors in support of the motion noted the
following points:
·
This motion is a combination of all three options.
·
The direction from Council on 2 October 2018 was to go out for
feedback and input on the three options. Councillors noted that it should not
be a tick box exercise but rather to receive input into a community-led
design.
·
Submissions noted a clear desire to pay homage to the original
design and return the flame to the building, ensuring the flame is at
forecourt level, 24/7 access and providing an area for reflection. This
motion recognises that the building and the whole site are key to the
memorial.
·
This motion provides clear direction to experts to produce
something for those sharing the space.
·
The concepts are broad enough to still allow flexibility in
design.
·
This is a good compromise and seems to be one that most can
live with. Any problems will be worked through in the design process.
·
As a gesture of good faith we should just go for it.
Councillors speaking against the motion noted the
following points:
·
Council is trying to design by committee.
·
The results of the survey were clear, with twice as much
support for the garden/landscape option than the next option.
·
Concern was expressed as to whether enough of the garden option
had been incorporated into the proposal given this was the strongly preferred
option through the consultation.
·
Giving officers such a prescriptive directive is limiting and
denies officers the ability to work with a clear mind.
·
The information was only provided to officers and some
Councillors at the meeting and it would have been useful to also have a
visual to help envisage what this proposal would look like, as was done for
the consultation options.
·
Further due diligence is required before a final decision can
be made.
Some discussion was held around the wording of the
motion with minor tweaks being agreed to by the mover and seconder.
Officer’s Recommendation
That the Strategy and Infrastructure
Committee:
a.     Note the
feedback provided by the community during consultation on design options for
a War Memorial, and
b.     Select
an option to develop a concept brief and subsequent construction of a War
Memorial for Napier.
Substantive motion
Committee's recommendation
Councillors
Brosnan / Wise
That the Strategy and Infrastructure

Considers the community feedback,
b.
Reconfirms its decision made on 27 September 2017 to locate the War
Memorial at the Floral Clock site, and
c.

d.
That Council staff take the following design direction to create a
final design concept for adoption by Council:
1.     That the
reinstated Memorial be constructed at forecourt level, on the floral clock
site, forming part of the War Memorial Site,
2.     That a
curved wall, open to the elements, mimicking the ballroom shape and
physically connected to the building, display the Roll of Honour,
3.     That the
Perpetual Flame be built into the existing War Memorial Building Entranceway
so that it is visible when entering the building, from the Memorial and
externally at night,
4.     That water
be incorporated into the design that is near to and complements the flame, so
that they can be viewed together,
5.     That a
place/s to sit and reflect be included,
6.     That
physical access and visual connection to the formal lawn be
incorporated,
7.     That
remembrance artwork be commissioned, to connect the Memorial space with the
Memorial Building and lower lawn, uniting the Memorial elements; and that
this be given as a brief to the Arts Advisory Group to commission,
8.     That
landscaping is included that complements and promotes restful contemplation,
and unites the Memorial Building with the Memorial elements,
9.     That the
design include flag poles connecting the Memorial and Memorial building,
10.   That WW1 and WW2
Rolls be displayed in a prominent way flowing onto future conflicts such as
Vietnam and Boer War Rolls,
11.   That the physical
original Roll of Honour be respectfully incorporated into the design and that
a small committee of appropriate representatives are given this brief, to
provide Council a recommendation on ‘how to incorporate’.
e.     Note
Councils intention to adopt a final design no later than August 2019 and
begin construction as soon as practicable in the 2019 calendar year.

7.1   Purpose
of Report
To approve a $50,000 grant to
Greendale Committee to contribute towards the restoration of the Taradale
School Pool (Greendale Pool).
At the Meeting
A Councillor spoke against the motion, noting that
Council will end up with two community pools in Taradale and that Council
would be supporting the upgrade of a 70 year old pool while planning to replace
a 20 year old pool in Onekawa.
Councillors speaking in support of the motion noted
the following points:
·
The Greendale pool is on Ministry of Education land and
initially they were not supporting the upgrade. They have now become
involved.
·
Funding of $50,000 is conditional upon receipt of a signed
tender agreement.
·
The Prebensen Drive aquatic centre will be a community pool and
offer a variety of other activities whereas the Greendale pool is just a basic
pool primarily used for lane swimming.
·
Council would be supporting the club in order to support the
community, much the same as Council has agreed to support the Napier Sailing
Club.
In response to questions, Council officers were
unaware whether Sport New Zealand had made any comment regarding the
Greendale Pool.
Committee's recommendation
Councillors
Wise / Taylor
That the Strategy and Infrastructure
Committee:
a.     Approve
that $50,000 be allocated from the 2019/20 Council Project Fund to the
Greendale Committee to restore the Taradale School Pool, conditional upon the
receipt of a signed tender agreement signalling the commencement of the
refurbishment work.
