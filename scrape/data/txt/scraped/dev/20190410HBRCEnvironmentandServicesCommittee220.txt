ANZ Sustainable Farming Presentation
Mark Morice presented a summary of an ANZ presentation given at a
recent field day about Greenhouse Gas Reduction obligations and initiatives
and the carbon market, with particular focus on implications for the farming
sector.  The presentation and discussions highlighted:
·
Carbon future has massive impacts on the
forestry and farming sectors, with concerns around land use and land value
for example
·
NZ is unique in that most greenhouse gasses
come from rural (agriculture) emissions – around 50%
·
Paris accord requirement that NZ reduce carbon
emissions by 30%
·
Productivity Commission report highlighted
that substantial afforestation is required to achieve the Government’s
emission reduction targets with rate of change required comparable to 90,000
ha of sheep and beef farms converted to forestry annually
·
Livestock Emission Cost to farmer $104/ha/year
liability assuming 100% of emissions – Government currently proposing
5% of agricultural emissions being included which currently equates to
$5.20/ha/yr.
·
Commission recommends a mix of farm-level and
processor level point of obligation for surrender in the Emissions Trading Scheme.
·
In summary our behaviour towards reducing
emissions will be driven by the price of carbon.

That the Environment and Services Committee receives the “ANZ
Sustainable Farming Presentation” by Mark Morice.

·
Key process is to assess the soil and water
resources and how the farming activities impact on those, including
