Keirunga Gardens Tree Management Plan (CG-14-1-01306) had been previously

A revised copy of the Keirunga Gardens Tree Management Plan (CG-14-1-01311) with minor amendments relating to Submission Nos.
119 and 187 was circulated at the meeting.
HEARING OF VERBAL SUBMISSIONS
Submission No. 187 - Pat Turley together with David Cranwell, Johno
Ormond and Jeff Whittaker (Save the Keirunga Oaks Campaign Group) displayed
a powerpoint presentation (CG-14-1-01322), including photos and highlighted
the following points:
·
Six well-qualified arboricultural and tree
experts say the Keirunga oaks are healthy, they are not dying anytime
soon.
·
Almost all of the Keirunga oak losses to date
have been by Council chainsaw error, not natural losses.
·
Keirunga has been harmed by prior
mismanagement and the wood needs and deserves proper arboricultural care.
·
Recommendations by Richie Hill advise on how
to protect and preserve the woodland and the historic values of Keirunga
Gardens.
·
No pruning policies for Keirunga appear to be
in place.
·
Overall the Keirunga trees display good
health.
·
Council’s Draft Management Plan would
have significant adverse effects on the values of Keirunga and George’s
Gully.
·
Council’s Draft Management Plan provides
no justification for 89 tree removals.
·
Council needs to shift away from
seeing trees as a problem and cost.
·
Only 3 of 210 submitters supported
the recommendation to fell 89 trees.
·
Would like better tree management
policies and works by Council staff for all public places trees and Keirunga.
·
Contractors working on public trees
need to be properly instructed and closely supervised by Council officers.
·
Consider a trust fundraising and
government structure for Keirunga Gardens.
·
Form a plan worthy of a legacy
woodland that is Keirunga.
·
Budget appropriately for Keirunga
Gardens.
Mr Turley supported
the Richie Hill Plan and the Officer’s Option Four the formulation of a
new community led Tree Management Plan.
Submission No.119 - Johno Ormond circulated information (CG-14-1-01327) and spoke to his submission highlighting the following points:
·
Proposal for the formation of a Keirunga
Woodlands Trust.
·
Council commit to enabling/facilitating a trust
and meeting trust
costs establishment.
·
Suggest 5-7 governance Board Trustees.
·
A theme from the submissions was to "Make The Track Better" and suggested a Loop Track
Development.
·
Create an accurate database of the trees and their state
as a base for future decision-making.
·
Future projects might include:
-
A memorial at the park entrance, as wished for
by the donors. Enhanced access to the grassy area above the woodland.
-
Substantial increase in signage to communicate
the history and ecology.
-
A Sculpture garden.
-
Further tracks.
-
Further planting of flora to increase amenity
value (low-maintenance flowering plants) and decrease maintenance costs
(plants as a natural weed cover).
Mr Ormond
supported the Richie Hill Plan and the Officer’s Option Four the
formulation of a new community led Tree Management Plan.
Submission No. 94 - David Cranwell spoke to his submission highlighting the following points:
·
Retain the trees.
·
Another walking path following the contour in
the area which currently has no trees and create a loop.
·
Believe there would be support for sponsorship
of new trees from individuals and groups.
Mr Cranwell supported the Richie Hill Plan and the Officer’s Option Four
the formulation of a new community led Tree Management Plan.
Submission No.185 - Joe Leete spoke to his submission highlighting the following points:
·
Retain as many trees
as possible.
·
The historic Pin Oak at St
Luke’s was an example of a tree that had been deemed to be unhealthy
with rot in the trunk.
·
Implementing Dr Alex
Shigo’s methods the tree has been regenerated and is now a healthy
specimen.
·
Keirunga Oaks unlike the
St Luke’s oak have no visible signs of internal rot.
·
Arthur’s Path has
been the subject of years of neglect.
·
Supports David Cranwell’s
submission for more maintenance.
In response to questions to the Save the
Keirunga Oaks Campaign Group the following
points were made:
·
Messrs Ormond, Leete, Cranwell and Whittaker would
all be interested in being on a proposed Trust
·
Mr Turley advised that as he was a member on
two other Trusts he would not put himself forward.
·
The submitters confirmed that the gardens
required some work as they had been neglected and agreed that some trees may
need to be removed with consideration and care.
·
Self-seeded oak seedlings could be left and
nurtured as would have better survival rate than planting new trees.
·
Supported a naturally generated woodland.
·
The Group supported the officer’s Option
4 for a community led Tree Management Plan.
·
A combination of governance and greater
involvement from the community to assist with the planting and maintenance
works of the gardens.
Submission No.120 - Ruth Vincent spoke on behalf of the Landmarks Trust to her submission
in support of the Arborlab report, subject to
amendments based on additional expertise and would like to retain as many
trees as possible.

The Parks and Property Services

A total of 210 Submissions had been received
with the majority of submissions opposing the draft Tree
Management Plan, especially in regard to felling the oak trees.
·
Only 5 submitters supported the draft Tree
Management Plan.
·
Key issues raised in submissions included:

Improve tree and park maintenance
-
Remove dangerous trees
-
Extend timeframe for tree removal and
replacement
-
Modify the planting palette
-
Support Richie Hill Plan
-
Support Draft Plan
-
Support Arborlab Plan
-
Miscellaneous requests
-
Support David Cranwell’s Plan
Councillors Barber and
O’Keefe  rejoined the meeting at 10.30am
There had been a lot of dialogue amongst
the community with some liking bits of the Aborlab Plan or the Richie Hill Plan,
which had not been publicly consulted on.
Mr Hosford acknowledged that the bulk of
the submissions were not in support of the draft Tree Management Plan.
However, a number of the goals and objectives in the draft
plan were also shared by the other plans.
Bringing forward a review of the Keirunga
Gardens Reserve Management Plan would enable sharing all the plans and
formulating a community led new vision for all of Keirunga Gardens.
Karl Burgisser – Arborlab
Consultancy Services Limited highlighted the
following points:
·
David Spencer, author of the report was unable
to attend.
·
All data captured electronically, although not
included, but was available electronically.
·
Risk  - organisations and councils have
requirement for the duty of care and would be defendable on international
best practice.
Chris Loughborough – Arborlab
Consultancy Services Limited highlighted the
following points:
·
A woodland was not a natural forest it was a
replication of an English Woodland and the species composition
different.
·
Keirunga Gardens was an artificial construct
of a woodland and does require intervention.
·
To maintain and protect the natural exotic eco
system it would require ongoing maintenance with a Woodland feel.
·
David Spencer’s management
recommendations were over a 10 year period.
·
The purpose of those recommendations was to
create the generation of a Woodland in a desired form as it is
currently.
·
Recommendations were for removal largely based
on invasive species as if unchecked would dominate the Woodland.
·
All removals proposed for forest regeneration
– replant or select regeneration.
·
Review of specie palatte in the original
document was not consistent with keeping the feel of a Northern European Woodland.
·
Richie Hill raised some good points.
·
Species diversity in this Woodland is greater
than an English Woodland.
·
Areas in the Woodland where the Red Oak are if
targeted by forest pathogen would decimate an area.
PRESENTATION OF VERBAL SUBMISSIONS
(contd)
Submission No.170 - Roger Mulvay spoke to his submission and highlighted the following points:
·
Supported the Arborlab
report.
·
The Arborlab report
proposed a balance between tree removal, height reduction, pruning and
replacement planting.
·
Extending timeframe for
tree replacement.
·
Congratulated Council on
arranging a peer review.
·
202 submitters want to
retain the trees.
·
Option 4 – involved more considered and
sustainable approach involving Council and the community.
·
Healthy trees would be retained and dangerous
trees removed, better well maintained park.
Mr Mulvay supported
the Arborlab Plan and the Officer’s Option Four for the formulation of
a new community led Tree Management Plan.
Submission No.171 - Peter Egerton spoke to his submission and highlighted the following points:
·
Retain the trees and
leave self sown trees to develop.
·
Select best seedlings, weed area around
seedlings with competing plants. Weed eat the rest until seedlings tall
enough to shade out the weeds.
·
Was not in favour of a Group as the more
people involved the stronger personalities would override with what they
wanted.
Mr Egerton
supported Officer’s Option 1 to leave trees to nature and maintain for
public safety only.
Submission No.184 - Di Reid spoke on behalf of Berry Small (Keirunga Gardens Heritage
Action Group) and displayed a powerpoint presentation (CG-14-1-01321)
highlighting the following points:
·
Like the idea of diversity bring more birds
and trees planted correctly.
·
Massive birdlife in Tainui Reserve but not in
Keirunga Gardens.
·
Clear ground of weed trees.
·
Acacia – Wattle, cut and remove weeds.
·
Prepare soil for replanting.
·
Plant new species flowering trees (plum,
cherry, etc) flax, fig to attract the birds to the gardens.
·
Concern of planting with poor tree maintenance
– as weed trimmers are ring barking the trees causing the trees to die.
·
Do not want trees all to be tested to be
healthy – don’t want big rates bill.
·
A wider variety of tree
species is desirable.
·
Do not believe that
trimming the Oaks as per Arborlab report is a good long term decision.
Mrs Reid advised that she would be prepared to have a
little input in regard to care of the Gardens but believed they should be generally
maintained with basic care as other parks in the District.
This completed the verbal
presentations.
Chris Ryan
spoke to the meeting in regard to the Draft Tree Management Plan and
highlighted the following points:
·
Proposed plan was a discussion document,
however there has been a lot of misinformation promoted by the Save the Trees
Campaign.
·
It is accepted there have been problems with
tree and park maintenance and this is a major decision
·
Regular maintenance can keep costs down low.
·
All spent a lot of time looking at trees but
no time looking at what is under tree.
·
Soil is crucial in growing.   Trees
growing in worst soil in Hawke’s Bay and has created a poor tree root
system which was the reason for cutting trees down.
·
Lack of communication between two groups
– increase biodiversity.
·
Keirunga Gardens could be developed for
education – an outdoor classroom.
·
Make gardens more attractive – have to
remove rubbish trees and replanting.
·
Stormwater and swimming pool water discharge
from houses above the red oaks has contributed to poor tree roots causing
trees to fall over.
·
Did not agree with Mr Turley’s
submission.
·
Limited tree species more risk with disease.
·
He did not support Option 4 as the more people
involved the more diverse ideas and problems and was anti big committees.
The Parks and Services Manager, Mr
Hosford together with the Parks Landscape and Projects Officer, Mr Leslie displayed a powerpoint presentation (CFM-17-24-3-19-277) and
highlighted the following points:
·
During the last two years there had been 11
tree failures, including 9 trees  falling onto other trees.
·
Key features of Chris Ryan
-
Recommended removal of 46 Oaks immediately and 48 other trees
over following three years.
-
Proposed tree removal due to evidence of root decay, poor tree
health and whole tree failure.
-
The removal created additional space for replanting with a
wider variety of tree species.
-
Removal of weed trees to create space for more appropriate tree
species.
-
Recommended new palette of trees to create  a diverse
arboretum style woodland.
·
Arborlab key features

Greater recognition of existing
woodland nature
-
Recommended increased general tree
maintenance
-
Recommended crown reduction of 23
trees and removal and 18 oaks
