Kevin Murphy, Event Manager
1.1   Purpose
of Report
To seek Council’s approval
for Neptune Entertainment to stage two concerts at Tremain Field in 2020.
At the meeting
A number of Councillors agreed
that it was appropriate for Council to collect a percentage of ticket sales.
In response to questions from
Councillors, the following points were clarified:
·
An alcohol ban will be in place for these concerts; this was
not the case for the Church Road concert that resulted in a number of
complaints.
·
The promoters are currently looking for artists.  Council
will address security concerns etc. with the promoter once the artists are
confirmed. A Councillor noted the importance of ensuring that the artist is
appropriate for the area.
·
Napier is currently limited to five concerts a year due to restrictions
at Church Road. Having an alternative venue would allow additional concerts
to be held in Napier.
·
The Chairman of the Napier Old Boys’ Marist Club was
present when the promoters were shown the venue. It is likely that the
clubrooms would also be used in some manner.
·
The last concert held at Park Island was around nine years ago
and was not well attended.
·
There are a number of similar venues around the country being
used for concerts. The promoters will be responsible for ensuring that they
meet Council’s requirements for use of a public space and a bond will
be required to cover the cost of any damage to the grounds/venue.
Council resolution
Councillors
Jeffery / Taylor
That Council:
a.     Permit
Neptune Entertainment permission to hold two one-day concerts on the Tremain
Field from 4:00pm to 10:30pm under section 53(1)(d) and (e) of the Reserves
Act 1977 on specific dates yet to be determined.
b.     Approve
the Chief Executive to negotiate a fair and competitive fee for the use of
Tremain Field. This fee would be a percentage of gross ticket sales.
c.     Approve a
licence for Neptune Entertainment to trade and allow the consumption of
alcohol on Tremain Field for the duration of each concert under sections 13.1
and 13.2 of the Napier City Parks and Reserves.
d.     Permit the
following areas as a “Specified Public Place” where consumption,
possession and bringing of alcohol into is prohibited on the day of the
concert (date to be confirmed) from 10:00am to midnight, pursuant to section
147 of the Local Government Act 2002 and the Napier City Council Public
Places Liquor Control Bylaw 2014.
e.     Permit the
following areas to be designated as “Specified Public Place” are
all those public, places, reserves, roads and footpaths on both sides of the
road within the area described as;

Reporting Officer/s &

2.1   Purpose
of Report
To present to Council the 2019/20
determination of the Remuneration Authority on remuneration for Elected
Members.
At the meeting
In response to questions from
Councillors, the following points were clarified:
·
The Remuneration Authority have set out the conditions that
need to be met for a childcare allowance to be considered by Council. It was
confirmed that any childcare allowance would sit outside the remuneration
pool.
·
The new Council will determine how the remuneration pool will
be allocated.
·
The current situation means that the Deputy Mayor’s
salary is unpaid and remains in the budget.
·
In relation to comments made around a perceived lack of encouragement
of elected member diversity, the Team Leader Governance confirmed that a
number of Council officers have been involved in general engagement around
elections alongside the other Hawke’s Bay Councils, Hawke’s Bay
District Health Board, Electoral Commission and a number of government
departments. This work and the resulting communications campaign has been
specifically targeted at traditionally disengaged groups including
non-pākehā and youth.
The following points were
raised for consideration by the new Council:
·
The timing of Council meetings should be considered as 3pm does
not suit elected members with school aged children and presents another
barrier to meeting their commitments as a Councillor.
·
The differential between the Deputy Mayor’s remuneration
and that of Chairs and Deputy Chairs should be reconsidered. A Councillor
noted that the current allocation of the pool does not accurately reflect the
additional duties of the Deputy Mayor.
A Councillor noted that they
did not believe the Remuneration Authority had appropriately considered or effectively
enabled diversity at the table in making this determination.
Council resolution
Councillors
Hague / Taylor
That Council:
a.     Adopt the
remuneration levels advised by the National Remuneration Authority for the
year 2019/20, from 1 July 2019 until the end of the day on which the official
result is declared for Napier City Council following the local government
election on 12 October 2019
b.     Note the
change in how the Authority sets councillor remuneration from 13 October 2019
(or post official result declaration) to a “governance remuneration pool”.
The Authority will then consider the councils’ recommendations before
determining the remuneration payable to newly elected members.
c.     Note
the Remuneration Authority has opened capacity for councils to provide a
childcare allowance at their discretion, and specified criteria that must be
met whenever payment of this allowance is being considered.

of Report
To present the draft minutes and additional summary of the
Clifton to Tangoio Coastal Hazards Strategy Joint Committee meeting held on 31
May 2019.
At the meeting
It was noted that the
contributory fund will essentially be starting costs only and will not go
anywhere near covering the cost of the infrastructure. A Councillor advised
that the difference in the funds required for Napier beaches compared to
Hastings beaches is due to the difference in cause and solutions required.
In response to a question
around insurance risk for Napier, it was noted that insurance companies are
taking a risk based approach and are looking at coastal erosion specifically
in terms of underwriting.

2.1   Purpose
of Report
To adopt the draft Napier Parking
Strategy and the Acquisition Guidance Report.
At the meeting
A number of Councillors noted
that until Council is able to meet the demand for leased parking they would
be uncomfortable with implementing a charge on current two hour free parking
spaces.
Council officers advised in
response that this decision had already been made by Council. The Strategy
allows Council to identify and develop specific sites that would be suitable
for parking. A strategy is required for this purpose particularly if Council intends
to use the Public Works Act to acquire the land. The Strategy identifies the
fundamental priorities for parking and enables Council to facilitate more
efficient use of carparking in the City.
A Councillor reiterated that the
feasibility of the Dickens Street West site should be assessed as an
alternative option when considering an additional parking deck at Tiffen
Street carpark, following comments made at the Strategy and Infrastructure
Committee meeting.
Council resolution
Councillors
Tapine / Hague
