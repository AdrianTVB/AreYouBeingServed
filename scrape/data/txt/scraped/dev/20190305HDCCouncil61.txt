CARRIED  

CAPE KIDNAPPERS HAZARD MANAGEMENT 
(Document 19/107) 
 
MOTION 

Councillor Redstone/Councillor Dixon 

That  Council  approve  Option  1  -  Not  undertake  a  Quantitative  Risk  Analysis 
(QRA)  and  remove  the  temporary  road  closure  notice  after  implementation  of 
reasonable control measures. 
 

Mr Shore, Geologist advised that his expert recommendation was that: 
 
 

The  beach  access  should  remain  closed  to  all  beach  users  until  a 
Quantitative  Risk  Assessment  was  completed 
the  risk 
associated  with  landslide  hazard  for  both  the  immediate  event  area  and 
the remainder of Clifton Beach between Clifton and Cape Kidnappers. 
 

to  assess 

He advised that to complete a robust Quantitative Risk Assessment QRA would 
take in the region of six months, including time for peer review. 
 
Mr  Smith,  General  Counsel  emphasised  that  the  Officer’s  recommendation  set 
out in Option 2 of the report was preferred because: 

 

 

 

It aligns with expert advice on the geological hazard,  

It represents a prudent approach to ensuring any legal duties Council might 
have are met. 

It  aligns  with  the  overall  purpose  for  Local  Government  to  minimise  the 
threat to public safety,

 

Is consistent with Council’s approach embodied in the HDC Enterprise Risk 
Management Policy and Framework. 

 
 
Councillor Schollum proposed an amendment to the Motion on table as follows: 
 
That  Council  undertake  a  Quantitative  Risk  Assessment  and  remove  the 
temporary road  closure, but go ahead with Option 1 in place. 
 
Mr S Smith advised that from a legal perspective opening up the beach without 
a  Quantitative  Risk  Assessment  would  place  Council  at  greater  risk  of 
prosecution, whilst acknowledging that this would impact on the community and 
local businesses. 
 
The  Risk  and  Corporate  Services  Manager,  Mr  R  Smith  advised  it  was 
pragmatic  for  Council  to  take  all  reasonable  steps  to  mitigate  risk.  Unless  a 
Quantitative  Risk  Assessment  was  completed  it  was  not  possible  to  determine 
whether the risk to beach users was within an acceptable tolerance level. 
 

The  Operational  Director,  Department  of  Conservation,  Mr  Reg  Kemper  joined  the 
meeting at 10.30am.

WAIVING OF STANDING ORDERS 
 
Mayor Hazlehurst/Councillor Redstone 
 
That in accordance with paragraph 13.3 of  Standing Orders Her Worship 
the  Mayor  exercised  her  discretion  to  waive  the  need  for  Councillors  to 
stand to speak during a Council meeting. 

CARRIED 

 
Mr Kemper advised that in terms of the Department of Conservation the Gannet 
Colony  Reserve  had  been  open  a  long  time,  but  they  had  been  unaware  of 
possible risks along the beach.  Now that the Department was aware of the risks 
it  would  close  the  track  access  to  the  Gannet  Colony  indefinitely  until  a 
Quantitative Risk Assessment could be undertaken and appropriate mitigation in 
place.    From  the  Department’s  perspective  it  could  not  knowingly  invite  the 
public into their site.   
 
Mr Kemper then responded to questions from the meeting. 
 
Following  considerable  questioning  and  discussion  the  Amendment  to  the 
Motion proposed was considered and addressed.
