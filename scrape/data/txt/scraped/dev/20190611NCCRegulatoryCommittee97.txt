1.1   Purpose
of Report
The report provides an analysis
of submissions received on the Statement of Proposal that will enable Council
to identify priority buildings under the earthquake-prone building legislation.
At the Meeting
The Manager Building Consents spoke to the report and
outlined the process undertaken to date. He confirmed that priority areas
have been identified based on documents and guidance from MBIE, and the next
step will be to engage an officer to check whether any unreinforced masonry
buildings are located within those areas.
In response to questions from Councillors, the
following points were clarified:
·
Priority areas were identified as being areas with potentially
unreinforced masonry buildings and high vehicle or high pedestrian traffic.
·
Most unreinforced masonry buildings in Napier were destroyed in
the 1931 earthquake. Those that remain would most likely be located in
Taradale or the CBD. Officers advised that they have been conservative in
their assessment by including other high traffic areas.
·
It was noted that some of the buildings that did survive the
earthquake will have already had strengthening work completed.
·
Urgency is required as Council has a statutory requirement to identify
the priority buildings by the end of this year. The sooner the priority areas
are identified the sooner an officer can be appointed to complete the next
stage of identifying the buildings.
·
Template letters have been prepared and will be sent out to all
affected building owners advising them of the next steps.

2.    Renewal
of Licence to Occupy - Sunday Market
Type of Report:
Operational
Legal Reference:
Reserves Act
1977
Document ID:

Reporting Officer/s &

Fleur Lincoln, Strategic
Planning Lead
2.1   Purpose
of Report
The purpose of this report is to
obtain approval in principle the granting of a Licence to Occupy agreement with
Margaret Habib of the Sunday Market for the carpark within the Marine Parade
foreshore north of Ocean Spa for a term of 3 years, subject to the s.54(1)(d)
Reserves Act 1977 process being successfully completed.
At the Meeting
In response to questions raised by Councillors, the
Strategic Planning Lead clarified the following points:
·
A traffic engineer was engaged to assess any potential safety
concerns in the area. The traffic engineer visited the market on six separate
occasions, one of which was while a large cruise ship was in town. The
conclusion was that although there is a lot of activity in that area while
the market is held, this did not cause a safety issue and he is confident
that the market can operate in a safe manner. He has made a number of
mitigation recommendations and is comfortable that Council approve the licence
to occupy.
·
It was noted that the initial trial period of one year was
extended to allow Council officers time to work with the market organisers to
resolve a number of issues.
·
There is only minor action required from depot staff, on
occasion, in relation to maintaining facilities at the site.
·
The only complaints received in the past have been from the
previous owner of another business that operated from the reserve. These
complaints had been dealt with by the Reserves Team and no complaints have
been received from the new owners of that business.
·
It was noted that the market organisers have asked for the
licence to occupy to be renewed. The organisers have expressed concerns in
the past with having to relocate, on occasion, due to other events being held
in the area. Now that an acceptable alternative location has been found, that
being Anderson Park, the organisers decided that this was an acceptable trade
off to be able to keep their prime location on the Marine Parade.
·
A more permanent location could not be found that meets the
organiser’s criteria for the site. The criteria includes but is not
limited to a 3000m2 hard surface area, facilities, power, walking distance to
CBD.
·
The size of the market will always be limited to the confines
of the space.
·
The market organisers are advised of other events as soon as
Council is made aware of the dates. In most cases they are given notice
months in advance as the events are mainly large annual events.
·
It was noted that the speed limit will be reduced just before the
car park entrance which should result in cars slowing down at that point as
they enter the lower speed area.
A number of Councillors expressed their concern around
a three year term for the licence to occupy. They believed that it would be
better to grant the licence to occupy for a shorter period to ensure that
staff continued to try and find an alternative permanent location for the
market. They noted that the current site is not a sustainable long term
solution and would like some certainty from staff that they will continue to
look for suitable alternatives. It was advised that the three year term was
proposed to give some certainty to the market organiser and store holders.
The size of the market was another concern for some Councillors
and it was noted that officers will continue to monitor the situation and
work alongside the organisers to resolve any concerns.
The Strategic Planning Lead confirmed that she would
provide a copy of the traffic engineer’s report to Councillors.
