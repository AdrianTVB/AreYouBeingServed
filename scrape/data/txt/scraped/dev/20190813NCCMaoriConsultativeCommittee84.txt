Advisor
1.1   Purpose
of Report
To advise on the progress of the parent
room facility and to identify a range of options for naming the facility.
At the Meeting
The Community Advisor spoke to the report, seeking feedback
on the name for a parent facility in Napier’s CBD. A name is sought
that reflects the purpose of the space, and that it is intended for any
caregiver and child up to 5 years of age to utilise. Feedback from Plunket
and the Hawke’s Bay Parent Centre was received, and further feedback
will also be sought through Kōhanga and early childcare education
facilities.
P Eden and N Mackie joined
the meeting at 3.12pm
C Ropitini joined
the meeting at 3.20pm
Committee members advised that it is best practice to
check Te Reo Māori names with any groups who may be associated with them
(Iwi or Hapu), and gain their permission to use the name. There has been
occasion in the past when inappropriate names have been used, and it has
caused offence.
In response to questions the following point was
clarified:
·
An English translation would help visitors to New Zealand to
know what the space is for, however there will be education about the space
locally, and a list or pictures of uses of the facility displayed.
Te kōhanga atawhai was the preferred name of the
committee as the word kōhanga relates to the care, love and nurturing of
children, which will be the purpose of the space. Council officers were
advised to consult Matua Hook  regarding the use of the name as he is
the Chairperson of the Te Kōhanga Reo National Trust.
It was noted that the English translation provided in
the report for te kōhanga atawhai  as being ‘children’s
nursery’ is not quite correct. Translated it is a birds nest. This
needs to be clarified, again with Matua Hook, but committee members confirmed
that this doesn’t need to come back through the Committee for approval.
Officer’s Recommendation
That the Māori Consultative
Committee:
a.       Consider
the feedback on the name options and provide advice on an appropriate name.

1.1   Purpose
of Report
To seek Council approval of the
draft Napier City Council Stormwater Bylaw 2019, the accompanying Statement of
Proposal and to authorise officers to commence the special consultative
procedure for adopting the bylaw.
At the Māori Consultative Committee meeting
It was noted in the
discussion that although it is good that this bylaw is taking steps to
protect the environment, and that there is a budget to start addressing pollution,
the past discharges by Napier City Council into the Ahuriri Estuary and the
ten year timeline to clean it up is concerning. The aspirational targets of
getting the Estuary back to being safe for swimming and for the collection of
kaimoana should be set as tangible measures to encourage progress. It is a
Treaty of Waitangi obligation to protect taonga, which the Estuary is.
In response to questions the following points were
clarified:
·
Approximately $26 million has been approved for investment into
the stormwater network and $10.5 million into the wastewater network. The
long term outlook is good. In the short term there is a lot of work to do,
and although Napier City Council’s environmental solutions team is quite
large compared to other Council’s nationwide, it is still a lot of work
for the resources available.
·
Upgrading stormwater and wastewater infrastructure will help to
prevent overloading of the system, which has led to the Council discharging into
the Estuary previously.
·
Water is the number one priority for Council. Councillors are
unhappy with previous discharges into the Estuary. It was noted that the new
network needs to be able to deal with the rise of extreme weather events too.
·
The new aquarium will aim to educate individuals about the
environment and conservation, and the aim is to reflect this educational
message in the Napier environment. It was noted that of the $45 million
dollar budget for the aquarium, $11 million will  be funded by Napier
City Council, with the balance being funded externally.
·
Hastings District Council is also part of the estuary issues,
but they are not included in this bylaw.
·
The bylaw will not be impacted by the Three Waters Review,
although the review will help to strengthen bylaws like this one.
·
Currently only high risk industry polluters are interacted with.
This bylaw enables warranted Council officers to investigate and interact
with all suspected polluters. Negligence by humans is one of the largest
contributors to the pollution in the stormwater network. Napier City Council
will be able to hold a polluter accountable and pass the cost of clean-up
onto them, rather than the ratepayers.
·
Iwi authorities and mana whenua groups have been identified,
amongst other groups, as being part of the wider consultation process.
It was agreed by the Committee members that they will
be telling their Board of Trustees, Marae and community’s to only vote
for candidates in the next local election who make this issue a priority.

Proposal, and;

of Report
The purpose of this report is to
obtain a resolution from Council on setting a date at which the Hastings
District and Napier City Council’s Joint Local Alcohol Policy (LAP) comes
into force.
At the Māori Consultative Committee meeting
It was noted that this
policy will help address anti-social behaviour in the community. It was also
noted that this policy has come about as a result of the lack of action at a
national level due to push-back from the liquor industry.

COUNCIL.

1.1   Purpose
of Report
The purpose of this report is to
provide the rationale for the proposed fees and charges increases for Bay Skate
for the 2019/20 financial year.
At the Māori Consultative Committee meeting
It was noted that after
robust discussion at the Finance Committee meeting, it was decided not to
increase Bay Skate’s charges at this stage as the risk of losing
customers outweighed the potential gain in revenue. The fees will be reviewed
as part of the next Annual Plan.

General
Business
Pukemokimoki Marae
This Marae was developed, with support from Napier City
Council, for the local community to have a place to celebrate cultural
activities and have a supportive environment to go to. It looks after a lot of
people and is well used. Council were asked to turn the sports ground into a
Marae reserve three or four years ago and nothing appears to have happened
about this. It was not originally Council land, but the Marae is not part of a
claimant group.
The following points were clarified during discussion:
·
The Principal Māori Advisor is happy to meet with
Pukemokimoki to find a way forward and advocate on their behalf to Council.
·
It was noted that Council is working on this issue and the Chief
Executive is on board; however, the matter is currently being held up due to
the legal process .
It was requested this item be added to the agenda for the
next Committee meeting to get an update of where things are at.
Recycling Bin Messaging
Council is looking for endorsement from the Committee in
relation to the proposed bilingual messaging on the new recycling receptacles.
Te Reo has been used on receptacles in other parts of the country. With 75,000
crates being produced, it is considered that this approach could be an effective
way to introduce Te Reo into more Napier homes.
The Committee confirmed that they
were happy to endorse the use of Te Reo on the receptacles. It was also
discussed that including the environmental principles (Recycle, Reuse, Reduce)
in Te Reo could be a good addition, either on the receptacles or in the
information packs.
Councillor Tapine closed the meeting with a karakia at 4.38pm.
Approved
and adopted as a true and accurate record of the meeting.
