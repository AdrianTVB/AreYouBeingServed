Seagrass in the Pōrangahau
Estuary
Anna Madarasz-Smith presented on the opportunities and issues in
the Pōrangahau Estuary with discussions highlighting:
·
Scientists found patches of Seagrass in the Pōrangahau
Estuary, an important habitat for many marine species that supports primary
productivity, stabilises the sediment, increases biodiversity and provides
food and habitat for many other marine species.
·
Declines of seagrass are well documented
nationally, and recent regrowth of seagrass has been seen in some places.
·
NIWA reports that due to increasing levels of
bacteria associated with faeces, longer-term persistence of seagrass in the Pōrangahau
Estuary is likely to be marginal under current water quality conditions,
meaning that it is at risk of loss.
·
Several projects initiated in the Pōrangahau
catchment that will in time improve the water quality and have multiple
benefits for estuarine health, diversity and recreation.
·
Opportunities will include mapping and
monitoring of seagrass population, stock exclusion, targeted retirement and
riparian planning – improvements that can have multiple benefits for
estuary health.
MC14/19
Resolution
That the Māori Committee receives and notes the
“Seagrass in the Pōrangahau Estuary” staff
report.

A range of objectives set for Lake Tūtira include establishment of forest
access roads, a post-harvest replanting plan to provide for various
identified values of the Tūtira Regional Park
·
Projects in partnership with
Maungaharuru-Tangitū
Trust (MTT) include establishment of an Integrated Catchment Management Plan,
working with landowners to create Farm Environmental Plans, development of a
cultural monitoring programme to support the water quality education program,
reconnection of Papakiri Stream to Lake Tūtira, implementing sediment mitigations, and installation of an
aeration curtain in Lake Tūtira.
·
Construction of second and final stage of
forest access road is expected to be completed by the end of April, and two
bridge crossings required at Papakiri and Kahakanui streams to access this
road.
·
Four options for the second forest access road
have been generated.  Decision will be made following discussion with
the company awarded the contract to manage harvest of the forest.
·
The post-harvest replanting plan has been put
on hold pending the completion of a Tūtira Regional Park FEMP being carried out under the Te Waiū o Tūtira Project.  A recommendation for replanting will then be
presented alongside other recommended actions arising from the FEMP.
·
Goal of all of this work is to restore the
mauri of Lakes Tūtira,
Waikōpiro and Orakai,
making them swimmable by 2020.
·
The integrated catchment management plan is
nearing completion and will be available in draft for the Lake Tūtira Governance Group to review
ahead of their May meeting.
·
22 landowners targeted for environment plans
in Tūtira, discussions
held with seven landowners and four FEMPs completed.

Farmers now developing actions from their
plans including slope stability planting by using exotic and native plants,
riparian planting and wetland development.
·
MTT will develop and establish a cultural
monitoring programme to support the water quality education programme in Tūtira.

to provide longitudinal flow and fish passage, improving the mauri of the
lake. MTT is to discuss the proposal at their next meeting to determine
whether they support the re-connection.
·
An Environmental Effects Assessment (as part
of the consenting process) is being done internally and is due to be
completed by June 2019 with focus on lake ecosystems, streams and fish
populations.
·
Sediment mitigations to be established within
Kahikanui and Te Whatu-Whewhe sub-catchments, reducing sediment entering the
lake system.
·
An aeration curtain is installed to improve
the water quality to a swimmable level.
·
Anna Madarasz-Smith advised that there is
ongoing removal of the invasive tubeworm in Ahuiriri estuary.
·
The Wharerangi Stream stabilisation plan is
currently in development to access the lower stem of the stream to provide
mitigation/actions to prevent further erosion of the stream banks and reduce
sediment loss.
·
Ahuriri Source model to identify water
pathways and contaminant transfer mechanisms to support management of
nutrients and bacteria is being reviewed by HBRC.
·
Potential actions for enhancing Lake Whatuma
are currently under investigation in collaboration with tāngata whenua

Dartmoor Eels
Chris Dolley a summary of the situation in
response to a recent eel kill incident, including investigations into adapting drain maintenance programmes to
protect the eels in the flood and drainage systems,
highlighting:
·
Heretaunga Plains Flood Protection Scheme
consists of 155km stopbank, 577km of river, stream and drainage channel,
287km of living edge protection, 196 structures, 5 detention dams, 18 pump
stations and 760 hectare land including river berms.
·
The purpose of the Scheme is to protect life
and communities, sustainable land use, protection and enhancement of river
sediment and protection and enhancement of social and cultural values.
·
Consistently reducing the flood risk to the
Plains while minimising adverse impacts of flood management methods on the
environment.
·
On 14 February 2019, staff carried out drain
maintenance using a dig and cart method which resulted in a large number of
eels being killed through the carting to the dump site. It was reported
immediately and all dig and cart on wet drains maintenance ceased. Currently under
investigation by Minister of Primary Industries and HBRC is cooperating fully.
·
Investigations into different methods of drain
maintenance has been initiated and all wet drain maintenance is on hold until
an agreed pathway is developed. A Task Team, led by Ant Rewcastle, has been
created to develop a new standard operating procedure.
·
Moving forward there are planned Environment
Training sessions for all Works Group staff during 2019 covering Codes of
practice and River Ecology Plans and the Environmental Code of Practice will
be amended based on recommendations from the Task Team

Update on the Pan Pac Discharge at
Whirinaki
Liz Lambert provided the committee of the
current activities undertaken, with discussions traversing:
Api Robin left the meeting at 12.57pm.
·
Pan Pac undertook two attempts to repair the
leak, over a period of weeks.  Both attempts were unsuccessful and
severely hampered by sea and weather conditions that made access and work
very difficult. Additional engineering and weather challenges have caused unavoidable
delays.
·
HBRC is comfortable with the reasons for the
delays and accepts the importance of the repairs being of a sufficient
standard and robustness to prevent further leakages before the pipe line is
replaced.
·
Pan Pac has almost completed a full assessment
to replace the old section of the pipe in the very near future.
·
Several matters were taken into consideration
in Council’s decision not to prosecute including that Pan Pac regularly
maintained and monitored the leak and that no evidence of negligence was
found.
·
Pan Pac has cooperated fully with the Regional
Council and has been in consultation with the community about the matter, and
Council is assured that Pan Pac is treating the matter with urgency and
keeping HBRC informed of progress.
MC17/19
Resolution
That the Māori Committee receives and notes the
“Update on the Pan Pac discharge at Whirinaki” staff
report.

Regional Council Chair and Chief
Executive Verbal Updates on Current Issues
As amended by
resolution 4 June 2019
Cr Rex Graham and James Palmer updated the meeting on current activities,
highlighting:
·
Council has not made a final decision on whether
to list Napier Port shares on the stock market. Two Joint Lead Managers have
been appointed and will be providing advice to Council. Due Diligence
Committee, comprised of key Advisors and Port directors and staff, will
be undertaking extensive due diligence of the Port
from accounting and tax, trade and economic, environmental and legal
perspectives. A Local Preference Scheme is being developed
to offer a percentage of shares to local Hawke’s Bay residents,
including taiwhenua, if Council decides to proceed. Corporate Entities in
Hawke’s Bay will include treaty claimant groups and will be offered a
separate preferential opportunity to buy shares. Council is considering the
appointment of two “majority shareholder appointed” new Port
Directors, one of which will likely be a Councillor.
·
Rex Graham and James Palmer met with Dave Paku
on Mātiti marae urupā.  HBRC Chairman Rex also
met with some team members on environmental issues, changes in the
environment and farm practices over the last decades. Great concern raised in
the number of suicides in CHB alone due to financial constraints, environment
issues and farm practices.  HBRC will take a balanced approach, but will
also continue to work to improve the environment.
·
James Palmer is arranging for a local
specialist to speak on the economics around forestation and carbon price.
There is a lot of pressure from equity companies internationally to plan
forestry in NZ.  Lots of issues raised in the current market which is
purely driven by economic factors outside HBRC’s control.
·
There are plans to plant more trees and plants
in Eskdale Park through a community driven process.  They should be
consulting with local taiwhenua and Peter Eden will make contact to discuss
that engagement.
·
One of the key messages from the Balance Farm
Awards was that last year’s winner can’t farm as they would
normally because they can’t meet the Plan Change 6 conditions and Hawke’s
Bay’s very best farmers are struggling to meet the new Plan Change
requirements.
·
Councillors and tāngata whenua representatives attended two recent workshops to
resolve issues of concern and build better relationships.
·
The relationship between the RPC and the Māori Committee and what the future
might look like after October elections when new Councillors are elected.
The next 6 months will be used to determine the relationship model HBRC wants
to use.  The process has started with good feedback received from PSGEs
and the next stage is to seek taiwhenua input.
Item not resolved
