Follow-up Items from Previous Regional
Council Meetings
In relation to
the publication of the LGOIMA requests received it was requested that in the
case where organisations are requestors those names be included in the report
to councillors, or alternately provide the information as a monthly report,
separate from the Agenda, similar to the resource consent applications
received.
In relation to
the Pan Pac replacement of the discharge pipe will be undertaken in four
stages as some sections are more recently constructed so do not need to be
replaced, with second section (from the beach side of the state highway to
where the pipeline joins the section that was the source of the leak) being
replaced starting next month.
Cr Fenton
Wilson arrived at 9.18am

Cr Bailey Notice of Motion:
Lapse of Water Bottling Resource Consent
James Palmer advised Councillors of his
concerns, as discussed with Councillor Bailey, about the notice being a
matter delegated for decision by staff, in relation to a specific consent rather
than the policy associated, and retrospectively seeking to overturn a
regulatory decision already made under delegated authority. Further, Mr
Palmer advised the notice being made during the electoral period is
problematic in relation to a councillor seeking re-election using council
resources which could be perceived to support their campaign and sought
withdrawal of the notice.  Councillor Bailey initially requested leave to
amend the notice of motion before proceeding to withdraw it.

Attended the LGNZ conference recently
Noted the good relationships between regional councils and
work well collaboratively, and  that this Council might take better
advantage of knowledge and information sharing in particular areas of
interest. Also commented on the relationship (tension) between Local and

The Regional sector tour is always a highlight and valuable,
