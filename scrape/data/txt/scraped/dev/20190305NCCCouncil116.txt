Craig Waterhouse – Pettigrew Green Arena
Craig provided a report to
Council on the annual performance of Pettigrew Green Arena (PGA), noting that
PGA leases space for community and commercial use but does not run programmes.
The following points were highlighted:
·
Community use has peaked; there is no more capacity at the
facility.
·
Council operational grants have significantly reduced.
·
They have stopped the gym decline.
·
There has effectively been a $2.4Million turnaround over the last
four years.
Upcoming projects were discussed including a standalone gym
entrance to allow 24/7 access, new operational offices, replacement of the
upstairs stadium seating and glass, and additional stadium space. It was noted
that a feasibility study has been completed for a standalone 5-6 court stadium
and that long term carparking is an issue with the site.
In response the questions from Councillors the following
points were clarified:
·
Community users have been given preference over commercial
bookings, with guaranteed bookings for eight weeks of the term. Prior to this,
community users had stopped booking Friday nights due to being bumped for
commercial bookings.
·
The Mayor noted that Hastings District Council would consider
contributing to the expansion project at a later date but have other
commitments at present.
·
If Sport Hawke’s Bay relocate to the Regional Sports Park,
EIT are the most logical option for a replacement tenant, and discussions are
underway in case this eventuates.

6.1   Purpose
of Report
This report provides the feedback
received during consultation on concept design options for a War
Memorial.  It is recommended that Council select an option in order to
proceed with development of a concept brief and subsequent construction of a War
Memorial for Napier.
At the meeting
Councillor Brosnan proposed a
substitute motion to the committee’s recommendation including slight
amendments to align with the Arts Policy, to address concerns raised by both
elected members and Council officers, and to support the tender process. She
noted that this is a community led design and the result of a thorough review
and extraction of submitters’ comments received through the
consultation process, and that Council has a mandate to support this
proposal.
The Mayor noted that he voted
against the committee’s recommendation at the Strategy and
Infrastructure Committee, and commented that the manner in which the proposal
was presented at the committee meeting meant that some elected members were
unable to visualise what was intended before being asked to make a decision.
However, following the committee meeting, the proposer has spent a
significant amount of time with elected members and Council officers to
address their concerns, and he advised that he is now able to support the
motion, although with some reservations, as he wishes to see the memorial
elements returned to the site as soon as possible.  The Mayor expressed
concern that the proposal is supported by a small group and questioned
whether the proposal represents the views of the wider community. He also
questioned whether the timeline was practical considering current staff
workloads, and whether anyone would submit a tender for such a sensitive
public project.
In response to questions
regarding the proposed timeline, the Director Infrastructure Services
acknowledged that the August 2019 deadline regarding tender development for
the design could be achievable; however, suggested that tender development
for the construction may be better aligned with the 2019/20 financial year
rather than the 2019 calendar year. The mover and seconder agreed to an
amendment to reflect this.
Following discussion around
the project budget, the mover and seconder also requested that it be
specified that the remembrance artwork was excluded from the construction
costs.
The following points were
raised during discussion:
·
Although only a small number of submitters suggested flagpoles
at the site, it was noted that Council had previously indicated that flagpoles
would be appropriate for the memorial.
·
The majority of submitters were in favour of the garden option;
however, comments received from those that weren’t in support of the
garden option felt that the memorial site was disconnected from the building.
A number of Councillors agreed that raising the floral clock site to
forecourt level addressed this concern, and in fact part of the floral clock
site at present is higher than forecourt level.
·
It was noted that Council made an error of judgement back in 2016
in voting to remove the memorial elements from the site. Council adopted the
consultation document last year which provided three concepts and requested
feedback from the community. The proposal is a combination of the
submitters’ comments received through that process and is therefore a
community led design.
·
This process has been a huge step forward in relation to
Council engagement with the community.
Substitute and Substantive

5.
That a place/s to sit and reflect be included,

7.

At the meeting
In response to questions from
Councillors, the Team Leader Governance clarified that the LGOIMA Policy had
been deliberately adjusted to a high level overview as this area is heavily
legislated with strong guidelines provided by the Office of the Ombudsman.
There is also a dedicated page on the Council website regarding the official
information request process.
Councillors were advised that
this is a legacy policy; although at the time of review Council officers considered
the option to propose repealing it in full, it was decided at this point in
time to adjust the level of the policy as opposed to repealing it. The
information and procedures that have been removed are captured in a number of
other places.

Maori Advisor
5.1   Purpose
of Report
To consider and approve the
reviewed Napier Roll of Honour for display at the War Memorial Centre site.
At the meeting
In response to questions from
Councillor Hague, the Strategic Māori Advisor reconfirmed the
eligibility criteria to be named on the Roll of Honour and clarified the
following points:
·
Council officers are concerned about the precedent that would
be set if Council were to include those names that have been clearly
identified as not meeting the criteria. Of the 15 names identified for
removal, a number died well outside of the New Zealand government conflict
period, returning to Napier after the conflict and living into their old age
- if the names were not removed, consideration would need to be given to all others
that served and returned to Napier but have not been recognised in this way.
·
Five of those identified for removal, Council officers and the
researchers involved are quite certain that they are either not real names or
have no association with Napier. It is thought that they may have been associated
with Napier by way of the name of their departure vessel ‘Hawke’s
Bay’ only.
·
One family has come forward to advise that their relative held no
connection to Napier and asked for the name to be removed. Another family
advised that their family member is recorded on another roll.
·
Without publicising the names and using the databases that the
researchers involved have had access to, Council would not have been able to
track as many families as they have. Council officers are certain that every
effort has been made to identify the individuals and track families.
·
As Council works through the detailed design phase, a space
will be considered for further names to be added, where appropriate. A policy
and procedure will be put in place regarding any supplementary plaque or
dedicated space for future additions. Although officers are confident that no
mistake has been made in identifying the 15 names for removal, if it is found
that names have been removed in error they will be able to be reinstated at a
future date in accordance with the policy.
Councillor Hague confirmed
that she would be happy to vote in support of the motion knowing that if a
mistake has been made in removing any of the identified names, that they can
be reinstated.
It was noted that the total
number of those that have served in various conflicts is unknown; however, on
average across New Zealand, it can be expected that the Roll of Honour
represents around 10-20% of those that served from the region. A number of
Councillors suggested that there may be opportunities through remembrance
artwork to also recognise all those that served including survivors.
Council resolution
Councillors
Price / Hague
That Council:
a.     Approve
the Napier Roll of Honour as an official Civic list of war dead for display
at the War Memorial Centre site, and:
b.     Approve
that 15 identified names from the 1995 Roll of Honour deemed by research to
have good and legitimate reason for removal are not carried forward to the
revised Roll of Honour.
