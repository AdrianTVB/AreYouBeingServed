Making Plan Change 5 Operative
Gavin Ide introduced the item with discussions highlighting:
·
Last steps in the process to make Plan Change
5 operative are adoption, affixing Council’s seal, public notification
and publication
·
Environment Court issued its final decision on
7 June 2019
·
Provisions relating to wetland areas on
private property and whether they increase Council’s rights to the
properties, particularly Lake Poukawa and Lake Whatumā
·
PC5 does not extend the impact of the rules
but clarifies the areas where the “wetland rules” apply as
identified on the maps
·
Request for staff to provide further clarification
regarding the implications for the implementation of PC5 in relation to both Council’s
functions and obligations and responsibilities of private land owners
·
Request for staff to provide further
information regarding Council’s approach to managing riparian margins
as a consequence of Plan Change 5.
RPC17/19
Resolutions
1.      That the Regional Planning Committee receives and considers the
“Making Plan Change 5 Operative” staff report.
2.      The Regional Planning Committee recommends that Hawke’s Bay Regional Council:
2.1.      Agrees that the decisions to be made are the result of Resource
Management Act plan change consultation processes and Environment Court
proceedings and therefore able to be made without re-consulting directly with
the community.
2.2.      Approves Change 5 (Land and Freshwater Management) to the Hawke's
Bay Regional Resource Management Plan in accordance with Clause 17 Schedule 1
of the Resource Management Act.
2.3.      Agrees to staff making the necessary administrative arrangements

TANK Plan Change - Feedback and Recommendations Following
Pre-Notification Consultation
The Chair introduced the item, noting that the previous
day’s TANK workshop had been useful and requesting that the Committee focus
on fundamental outstanding issues requiring discussion. Key discussion points
included:
·
The purpose of today’s meeting is to
clearly identify what the problems and issues are and to navigate around
them.
·
Tangata whenua members were at first opposed to
flow enhancements, and proposed that the allocation limit of 90 million m3 be reduced to 80 million m3 over
10 years and requested modelling of the current actual use.
·
Tangata whenua requested the addition of some
interim targets to reduce water usage, and if reductions are going to be
implemented that the “savings” be re-allocated back into the
environment and not re-allocated for other usage
·
Tangata whenua requested that the Plan better
provide details for values like the relationship of Māori and their
taonga, kaitiakitanga, and take account of the principals and values of the
Treaty of Waitangi
·
Committee members were supplied with a summary
document from the Technical Advisors prior to commencement of the meeting, outlining
the outstanding issues from the tangata whenua hui.
·
It was suggested that the Committee work
through the issues not yet addressed prior to the next Regional Planning
Committee so that staff could bring a revised version of the Plan Change to
that meeting for notification
·
S32 report is to be presented at the 14 August
RPC meeting
·
It was agreed that a smaller workshop group will
undertake discussions on the outstanding items, namely Stream flow
enhancement, groundwater allocation limits, provisions for tāngata
whenua (sections 6e, 7a, and 8) and alignment between the outstanding water
bodies and TANK plan changes.
·
James Palmer invited the independent advisors,
Riki Ellison and Billy Brough, and representatives from the TANK Treaty
Partner Working Group, Marei Apatu and Ngaio Tiuka, to be party to the
discussions at both the workshop and the RPC meeting to address any concerns
and issues raised.
The meeting adjourned at
11.25am and reconvened at 11.44am.
·
Tangata whenua want to ensure the sustainable
management of the resource and consider it appropriate for this Plan Change
to set targets for reducing water usage.
·
Staff noted that the Heretaunga Plains
integrated ground and surface model was used to predict the effectiveness of
a range of management options to manage the stream depletion effects,
including restrictions or bans, allocation reductions and stream flow
enhancement.
·
Independent advice received from a tangata
whenua [CE1] appointed hydrologist
noted that even at zero water take, flow enhancement is needed.
·
The Plan enables permit holders to
collectively consider other measures to ensure stream flow does not fall
below the triggers and to cease takes when trigger flow is reached. The
Policy must clearly indicate that it is an enabling provision and provides
opportunity for flow enhancement as an alternative to more stringent water
take bans.
·
The policy currently states that the Council
will remedy, or offset if remedying is not practicable, the stream depletion
effects and effects on tikanga and matauranga Māori.  In the absence of augmentation, to provide for those
values would require high level spring-fed contributions to the low-land
streams, resulting in significant reduction of water takes during dry periods.
·
The policies and rules provide a comprehensive
ruleset of measures to address the issues and cannot be considered in
isolation
·
suggested a remedies table be included before
Policy 34 under Heretaunga Plains Freshwater Quantity Management.
·
Flow enhancement and restrictions are
temporary tools to achieve better outcomes and to maintain the ecosystem
health of the stream and the economy.
·
Agreed that efficiency reduction and
restrictions be placed on all water users and that no increases in allocation
will be made
·
Tangata whenua sought feedback and any related
legal advice (if available) on the statement “The Council must have
particular regard to any advice received on a draft proposed policy statement
or plan from iwi authorities.  This does not mean that the Plan Change
must be amended as requested by the iwi authorities, but the RPC must at
least consider that feedback alongside the many other considerations”.
The item was not resolved
The meeting adjourned at 1.03pm and reconvened at 1.38pm with Cr
Paul Bailey and Apiata Tapine not in attendance.
8.
TANK Plan Change Options for Notification and Beyond
Considered in conjunction with Item 7 and
deferred to the 14 August RPC meeting.
It was suggested that the Planning Team approach
the Ministry for the Environment to explore a streamlined planning process,
and that a targeted workshop group meets to discuss the four fundamental
issues raised by the tāngata whenua representatives, prior to the 14 August
2019 RPC meeting.
The item was not
resolved
9.
Outstanding Water Bodies Plan Change 7
Belinda Harper provided an overview of the process prior to 2017 including
the rationale for the plan change direction.  Keys discussion points
covered:
Cr Paul
Bailey and Apiata Tapine returned to the meeting at 1.41pm
·
Outstanding Water Bodies identified for outstanding values only
·
Originally twenty two candidate outstanding
water bodies identified by the RPC
·
information gaps filled through hui with iwi
authorities, key stakeholders and district and city councils
·
43 water bodies identified as outstanding
despite a recognised lack of supporting information for some of those
·
15 May RPC meeting decided that the full list
was retained for pre-notification consultation
·
Pre-notification consultation received 13
responses from 55 parties feedback was sought from
·
Key concerns raised included a lack of clarity
of the difference between outstanding and significant values and implications
for resource consent applications.
·
Key amendments made include:
°
Defer application of Policies LW3A & C2
until a relevant catchment based plan change is operative, RCEP review is
complete or after 31 December 2025 whichever is sooner and specify what
activities they relate to
°
Definition of “outstanding”
°
Amended Schedule 25 to re-join water bodies previously
separated into lower/upper, include descriptions of outstanding values
and only include water bodies with sufficient information to support an
outstanding status
°
Removed Boundary Stream/Shine Falls
°
Include descriptions of significant values – water bodies
in TANK catchments
·
Option 1 supported due to the risks associated with delaying/not
progressing Plan Change 7 if RPC cannot agree to “short list”
·
Key difference between options is the number of water bodies
identified, with Option 2 identifying only those (20) with robust evidence
base
·
Next step is to adopt the proposed Plan Change
7 for notification
·
Tangata whenua tabled an alternative
“option 3” to delay notification of the plan change until after
tangata whenua are provided with the opportunity, including resourcing, to
provide additional evidence to support all 43 water bodies identified by 30 November 2019.
·
It was highlighted that should Option 3 be accepted, progressing
Plan Change 7 and subsequent plan changes (e.g. TANK) would be at risk.
·
Tangata whenua requested the meeting adjourn for a short period
to allow them to further discuss the options.
The meeting adjourned at
2.33pm and reconvened at 2.58pm.
·
Option to delay notificateion of the plan change until after 30
November 2019 was withdrawn and Tāngata whenua agreed to accept Option 1
subject to funding being provided for identified iwi authorities to provide
additional evidential information to support the outstanding status of the
water bodies listed where gaps have been identified.
