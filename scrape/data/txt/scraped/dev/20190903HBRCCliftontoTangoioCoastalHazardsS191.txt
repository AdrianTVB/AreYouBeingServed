Call

Recommendations
That the Clifton to
Tangoio Coastal Hazards Strategy Joint Committee accepts the following
“Items of Business Not on the Agenda” for discussion as Item 9:
Topic
Raised by
6.
Assessment Panel Supplementary
Recommendations
The report was
taken as read with few minor discussions on the supplementary recommendations
made by the Northern and Southern panels:
·
The Supplementary Recommendations were made by
the Panels in addition to the main recommendations on the 100 year pathways.
·
With the focus of TAG and the Joint Committee
on pathway implementation, the Panel’s supplementary recommendations
have not yet had a formal response from Council’s.
·
To address this, TAG have proposed a response
to each supplementary recommendation, for Joint Committee consideration.
·
This is intended to assist with accountability
and transparency in responding to the supplementary recommendations to be
actioned appropriately.
·
TAG will advance the matters as outlined over
the coming months and will provide progress updates to future Joint Committee
meetings.
·
Disucssion:
·
Westshore (Unit D) (A):  comments have
been raised from mana whenua reps in the past around possible sedimentation
effects on reef systems from renourishment.
·
Whirinaki (Unit B):  Concerns raised on
the urupa around the coastal areas – the discussions was that
structures are being proposed at the coastline to protect the urupa but that
this approach should be discussed further with mana whenua.
·
Southern Panel, page 17, (D):  Groyne
saddle needs to be filled so that the beach can be build back up:
Matter has not been considered by HDC and not being
resolved.  Refer to TAG for a follow-up.
·
Item (F), Page 17:  An imminent threat at
Cape View Corner – HDC has a limited amount of funds to replace some of
the shingle material that is being removed by ongoing storm activities.
HDC and HBRC have agreed to investigate options for short term protection of
cape corner and H21.  Will revert back to committee in to what those
opportunities are.
·
HDC to confirm resourcing for this particular
work to be supported by the modelling team.  TAG to follow up on this
matter around timeframes.
·
Bay View (Unit C), Page 13:  Concerns
raised on whether the Recommended Council Action ”TAG to maintain
watching brief on future consent applications for renourishment activity at
Westshore”  being sufficient enough?  Proposed that a letter
from Cr Peter Beaven be written to HBRC highlighting this concern and asking
that any consents for this activity TAG be informed and the matter
specifically considered.
CLI120/19
Resolution:
That the Clifton to Tangoio Coastal Hazards Strategy Joint Committee
receives and notes the “Assessment Panel Supplementary
Recommendations” report.

Project Manager's Update
Simon Bendall
gave a broader update on the progress made in each of the five workstreams of
Stage 4.  Discussions highlighted:
·
The five interrelated workstreams to complete
the work consists of the following workstreams:  Design, Triggers,
Funding, Governance and Regulatory.
·      The Design Workstream is lead by in-house
expertise from HBRC and is progressing well.
·      Triggers Workstream:
·
Signals and triggers are required in order for
the pathways to be adaptive.
·
The Triggers workstream is being led by Napier
City Council and will develop signals, triggers and thresholds for each
priority unit of the coast.
·
One challenge is that signals and triggers
have not been developed for coastal hazards pathways anywhere else in New
Zealand.
·
Awaiting a report from Deep South National
Science Challenge due in October 2019 which will present learning from a
series of workshops held on signal and trigger development. This will provide
useul resoruces for TAG in designing a process to develop these
locally.
·      Funding Workstream:  The
development of a funding model to support the implementation of the Strategy
has taken a considerable amount of time over the last 12 months.
·
Various workshops were held with Council Chief
Executives and Partner Councils to explore ideas on the contributory fund
concept.
·
The outcome of the workshops and discussions
on next steps will be discussed during the workshop component today.
·      Regulatory Workstream:  Councils
are all heavily engaged with various plan change and policy projects which
has placed a strain on internal resources.
·
TAG are considering options to advance the
work with consultant support, which will have budgetary implications that
needs to be worked through.
·
Questions arose as to how the scope of the
regulatory framework will work.  Looking to focus on 4 key questions
listed in par 22 of the paper.
·      Governance Workstream:  Currently
on hold while efforts are focused on  Funding Workstream as there are
interrelationship and overlaps and borader governance questions are being
addressed through discussions on funding. To be revisited once funding matters
are more resolved.
·      Progress summary:  Overall the
project is tracking in accordance with the overall project plan.
·
Some key challenges of projects are Funding,
Regulatory and Triggers.
·
TAG are actively working on solutions to the
above challenges.
·
The project has underspent $30,000 against
budget in the 2018-19 financial year.
CLI121/19

Current Coastal Projects Update
The Chair
noted that an update on Whakarire Ave Revetment works has been delivered by
Dean Moriarity at the start of the meeting.
Chris Dolley gave an update on the Port of Napier,
highlighting:
·
A Working group, (represented by Napier Port,
Westshore Residence Association, Hawke’s Bay Regional Council, Mana
Whenua Steering Committee and the Napier City) have been established to
consider / provide overview for maintenance dredging of sand in the Port of Napier,
to commence late October 2019.
·
Volumes of sand is around 60,000m3
to be disposed into Westshore.
·
The health of the Rangatira reef has been
raised as a concern by Mana Whenua Steering Committee – the sediment
caused by renourishment of a great concern.
·
Any application for resource consent for this
activity will need to specifically address actual and potential environmental
effects and include consultation with Iwi.
·
The working group meets monthly and are
progressing well.
·
There will be a joint media statement from all
the representatives in the Working Group around the maintenance dredging.
·
It was proposed that Port of Napier give an
update in early 2020 on the construction work of Wharf 6 and when it will
commence.
Craig Goodier gave an update on the Extended consent area for sand
deposition at Westshore, highlighting:
·
HBRC have engaged an ecological consultant to
provide advice on the potential effects of the sand deposition in the
nearshore area.   The consultant has conducted field tests, and has
provided a report on findings.  The findings provide general guidance
that the potential ecological effects are likely to be minor and short
lived.  They agree with the adaptive management approach, which would
enable some material to be placed in the new zone, then monitored to
determine if there are any undesirable effects.
·
Next stage is to meet with the planning
consultant and work on a program of consultation with affected parties, most
importantly the iwi groups which have interest in this area.
CLI122/19
Resolution:
That the Clifton to Tangoio Coastal Hazards Strategy Joint Committee
receives the “Current Coastal Project Update” report.
